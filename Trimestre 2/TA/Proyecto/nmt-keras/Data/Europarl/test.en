the committee on economic affairs takes the view that quantitative economic targets may be useful , but insists that the fixing of such targets must not undermine the goals established in the stability pact , which are the fundamental guide for the economic policies in the euro zone .
as far as financial services are concerned , having reached a broad consensus of agreement , we shall be tabling a joint amendment calling for the action plan for financial services to be applied more quickly , i.e. by 2003 rather than 2005 .
the majority of the committee believes that mobilising the market will result in the need to increase investments using purely market instruments .
at the same time , however , it approves of the restructuring of government spending in favour of investment which must be justified - when it is justified - by the cost-benefit ratio , but rejects using public investments simply to manage the economy .
it therefore calls upon the commission and council to seriously consider the need for a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind the general guidelines .
the committee also reiterates parliament &apos; s previous call for an interinstitutional agreement between the council , the commission and the european parliament on the subject of the adoption of the resolution , although it thanks the portuguese presidency for its willingness to cooperate on this matter .
this is ad hoc cooperation , however , not cooperation reflected in an interinstitutional agreement , and we consider this a shortcoming in our procedure .
ladies and gentlemen , we achieved a significant degree of consensus in our work in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
i should like to stress the general acceptance of the feasibility of the objective of achieving full employment within the next decade .
of course , there are certain differences in our assessment of the best way of achieving these targets .
some of us believe that setting quantitative targets , even without mechanisms for imposing them , would help europe give concrete expression to its efforts to move in the right direction .
this comment applies in particular to the target investment rate , which requires us to increase the potential rate of growth of the economy to 3 % on a permanent basis .
this percentage is a familiar figure .
the commission set it repeatedly in its studies and it would not have hurt to have included it .
we could also have given more categorical expression to the , i believe , general feeling that we need to relaunch the trans-european networks and address the need for new forms of financing for them and the issue of the involvement of private capital and public investment in this sector .
without , in any way , giving the green light to squander public spending , we could have tried to give the public sector of the economy a slightly more positive role than merely that of &apos; guard-dog &apos; for price stability .
there are margins for all this , especially through the window of opportunity , if the main risk to our economy is from the probability of a crisis on the american money markets which could paralyse the private investment mechanism .
just imagine , ladies and gentlemen , if that were to happen and we , in the meantime , had forgotten how to handle public investment .
the european economy has a huge margin for growth ; it is true that the european economy can become more productive , but we need to be bolder in the way we go about it .
mr president , when drawing up this draft opinion for the committee on economic and monetary affairs , the committee on social affairs fully appreciated the importance of this resolution , parliament &apos; s first resolution on economic policy guidelines since the lisbon summit .
in our opinion , the open method of coordination , which was introduced on an experimental basis in lisbon , should allow for the full exploitation of the connection between growth and employment , which , we feel , cannot be ignored .
mr president , the liberal group will support the katiforis report on the broad guidelines for economic policies , which we are especially satisfied with since many of our observations were accepted during the debate in committee .
therefore , the fact that , in some ways , the us economy is doing better than the european economy , at least in terms of growth forecasts , should not mask the fact that the european economy is doing well at the moment .
furthermore , it is the european economy which is funding a good portion of us development .
however , we should not only be concentrating on the more positive aspects ; we should also be taking note of the fragility of continued growth and solidity in the european economy .
in order to overcome this fragility , in our view , we need the european economy to function better , since it is still subject to excessive corporate rigidity , in both the public and private sectors , and on the part of both economic and social operators .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , let me tell you why the group of the greens / european free alliance did not vote in favour of the katiforis report as amended by the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
obviously , we endorse the general thrust of the katiforis report .
in particular , we approve of the ambition to achieve full employment as well as its ambition in terms of sound social and , above all , salary agreements .
on the other hand , we did not endorse a raft of amendments which we considered to be extremely dangerous .
we shall reject these amendments . indeed , we shall reject them systematically , and we hope within the current parliamentary term to convince our fellow members , including those in the group of the european people &apos; s party , how dangerous they are .
in the first place , we can no longer continue to call for the flexibility of wage contracts to be reformed and increased without specifying our thinking more precisely .
endorsing the goal of a european society which is as competitive as possible in terms of know-how means maximising investment in human capital .
well , enhanced human capital is not a commodity to be taken and then dispensed with , but rather something to be respected , something that is offered to an individual by allowing them time to be trained , to gain and enhance experience .
so if there must be structural reform in wages , then it must be in the direction of greater , and not less , stability in employment .
there is a second fundamental point of which i desperately hope to convince my fellow members in the next five - now four - years , and that is that we cannot claim to wish to respect the kyoto agreement by the year 2008 .
- ( el ) mr president , the commission &apos; s recommendation for the broad economic guidelines for 2000 may well accept a return to full employment , but it has stood by the basic approach of previous years .
although i recognise the contribution made by parliament and our rapporteur in gaining acceptance once again for the concept of full employment , i think that the rapporteur himself , whom i congratulate on his efforts , would agree that we need to redefine what we mean by employment and by full employment .
what does employed mean when we have before us a policy which dismantles working relations , minimises employment and , as a result , makes general poverty a mass phenomenon .
as far as its general approach is concerned , the commission &apos; s recommendation forms part of a more general neo-liberal economic and social policy which , with the support of the majority of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , finds expression in the report under discussion .
as far as we are concerned , the basic policy objectives should be to support public investment , stable , permanent and full employment , protect and improve the social security system and the system of social protection in general and strengthen active demand by improving the purchasing power of the workers .
this is the direction the broad guidelines should be taking .
the amendments which we propose to the european parliament move in precisely this direction and we call on our fellow members to vote in favour of them .
there is not a word , however , on the current depreciation of the euro and its influence on the economy and economic policies .
this seems all the more surprising because every few pages the commission document reiterates the idea that efficiency demands an overall strategy .
the same is unfortunately true of the european parliament &apos; s report since , out of the 35 points raised in the resolution , not one relates to the single currency , and it is only briefly referred to in the recitals .
apparently , the rule of silence is prevailing , as it did when the major groups within parliament rejected the proposal from the union for a europe of nations group to organise , as of today , a debate on the implications of fluctuations in the euro .
this debate has been deferred once again , even though there is a great deal to be discussed .
for years , all the economic and financial advantages a strong euro was going to offer have been trotted out for our benefit .
now the euro is weak , are we to assume that the loss of these advantages has no implications worth mentioning ?
this is surely some mistake !
finally , the basic problem still remains .
this depreciation in the euro has occurred because it is perceived as an artificial currency , but until this is clearly stated it will not be possible to remedy the situation .
in this instance too , then , let us hope that the european parliament agrees to organise a debate in the near future , before it is too late .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , having scarcely emerged from the dull 80s , europe has been plunged into the throes of international speculation .
we were promised a euro-cum-mark that would be stronger than the dollar , and which would compensate for the weakness of economic growth by means of the on-going revaluation of assets .
we have an ersatz currency whose volatility is enhanced by its non-identifiable character .
formerly , speculation on the exchange market involved the pound .
now it is the euro .
this is nothing particularly surprising for us members of the european parliament who are accustomed to seeing europe operating on a daily basis amid differences and antagonisms .
what will the situation be like after enlargement , when the markets will react to any event affecting any one of the thirty odd countries which make up the european technostructure ?
it would almost be like the united nations issuing a currency .
this reduction in the value of the euro is not something that mr duisenberg can do anything about , as this european central bank , whatever they say , is the brainchild of the two main states in the euro zone , and the french and german governments have given the order to do nothing .
in order to maintain the value of the euro in relation to the dollar , we should have to raise euro interest rates to a level which is slightly higher than that of the dollar , perhaps to a level in the order of 50 base points .
from my standpoint as a post-keynesian , i see this as having little impact on economic growth , since this depends on various other factors , the most important of which are psychological .
obviously , we cannot agree to all assets located in france being devalued if the downward slide of the euro continues beyond the short term .
if this should happen , and obviously we hope it does not , then we should have to point the finger at the parties responsible , and this would not mean mr duisenberg .
we shall judge the candidates in the french presidential elections according to the efforts they have made to get us out of this bind .
mr president , the report is self-contradictory .
paragraph 14 supports the stability pact &apos; s demand that price stability should always precede employment-related considerations .
elsewhere , the desire is for higher employment and more democratic influence upon economic policy .
however , inflation should always , of course , be between zero and two per cent .
this is something that is supported , even though inflation has only stood at that rate for a period of six years in post-war germany and denmark .
it is now quite certain , however , that this state of affairs will always be best for all countries at all times .
we no longer have any need for elected representatives to devise the right policy mix .
we have a central bank which establishes interest rates on the basis of inflation .
in this way , the euro is allowed to depreciate and interest rates are increased with the result that there may be lower rates of growth and increased unemployment .
it is worse than the sacred cows in india , yet the report does not protest against this .
in paragraph g , on the other hand , a new sacred cow is to be found : that of high taxation .
social security arrangements must be critically examined and social expenditure reduced , but savings can also be made on social expenditure by making higher employment the top economic objective .
in that way , people receiving cash benefits and unemployment benefit will be able to exchange these for proper wages .
that is an alternative recipe for economic policy , but one which is contrary to the treaty .
the balance of trade deficit is normally to be no more than one per cent of gnp , irrespective of whether the money is used for investments , which can subsequently produce much larger deficits again . this would seem to be something which no amount of elections in the member states or in the eu parliament can change .
mr president , i enthusiastically support the further deepening of integration .
many matters are best dealt with at community level , but when i read the report of my colleague mr katiforis - which provides several guidelines which are favourable to the market economy and therefore worthy of support - i cannot agree with some of the proposals in it .
something which i have reservations about is the faith in the importance of top-level structures which stands out in this report ; a programme and planning from the top may actually put the brakes on development rather than make it dynamic .
at present , european dynamism will be improved by dismantling top-level structures , for example , barriers to trade , which are still hindering the creation of a genuine internal market .
this is what mr katiforis is also calling for , albeit of the commission , when it should be demanded of those nation states , which - in a few individual cases - practice obstructionism , for example , in the areas of transport , public procurement or energy .
when discussing economic policies in the context of this report , we should not forget about competition policy .
recently , the neutrality of the communities &apos; competition policy has been called into question - justifiably so - inter alia in the case of volvo-scania .
the reason given for regional monopolies and concentration of power in regions with a small population base is rather lame .
it is clearly a real blow to the industry and trade of small and remote countries while they are making efforts to increase their competitiveness within the union area .
mr president , i congratulate mr katiforis and commissioner solbes , both of whom have displayed a broader than usual understanding of what is necessary for a successful economy .
we must take advantage of the fact that we are in the european union to do things collectively .
i wish to concentrate on research and development .
i regret that the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy did not draw up an opinion on mr katiforis &apos; s report - it should have done .
we need scientists in order to have research and development .
let us stop young people choosing to do other things .
let us encourage women .
let us ensure that competence in widely-used languages is increased .
above all , let us look at the salaries paid to scientists and technologists .
that is what makes them choose other careers .
of course , we need infrastructure in science facilities and communications .
we need a strategy .
jacques delors spelt it out in his white paper , so we do not need to reinvent his thoughts .
however , the big difference between us and the successful economies of the world - the us in particular - is that they spend far more money on investment in science , and it pays off .
commissioner busquin &apos; s communication on the european research area is very good .
however , what is important is the next stage : transferring that knowledge into goods and products and processes which can be sold .
let us be innovative in the european union .
let us start by bringing the innovation unit back from luxembourg to brussels , where it can use its skills working with other departments of the commission .
that would be a not very revolutionary but a sensible thing to do .
the ambition to achieve full employment and a modern economy , as declared in lisbon , are indeed laudable objectives , but they are now effectively coming up against the liberal yoke .
in its document on the broad economic guidelines , the commission pursues this liberal approach , and these guidelines now represent the reference text for the coordination of economic policy in the member states .
the commission , indeed , shows no compunction in issuing orders to this or that state with a view to drawing up its budget .
it clearly stresses the target of budgetary streamlining , even going beyond the requirements of the stability pact .
following the example of the central bank , it demands wage moderation as well as structural reform of the labour market , especially in order to make it more flexible .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs &apos; report is in line with this approach and with the continuation of the lisbon decisions .
it advocates accelerating the liberalisation process as well as the process of applying pressure to wages . it proposes increasing the flexibility of the labour market .
this is why i am unable to approve of the guidelines contained in this report , especially when made exacerbated by the many amendments introduced by the right wing .
the current economic situation , particularly with the decline in the euro , ought to lead the union and the member state governments to strive towards the reorientation of european policy , so as to enable it at last to fulfil expectations regarding social issues .
we must shake up the dogma of the stability pact .
we must reverse the current approach , which makes social policy nothing more than a consequence of economic and monetary policy , responsible only for making good the damage caused by the market by means of a policy of aid .
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteurs on the very points which so displeased the previous speaker , i.e. the sections of the reports which display a liberal approach .
this is one of the shortcomings of the euro , a currency which is suffering from a structural crisis and inflexible , excessively regulated markets .
some say that political control of the economy at european level would be a way of resolving this crisis .
beware !
if political control has to be a means of control which transfers the interventionism of national economies to brussels , this would be a bad move .
we italian radicals are also in favour of political control , but federalist , liberal control , with a limited number of clear laws and no state intervention in the economy , even by the european state .
mr president , the present draft resolution by mr katiforis contains many valid points .
we should , however , qualify one key point concerning a matter of principle .
both the commission &apos; s recommendation and the resolution claim high economically sustainable growth as the highest good and pursue this remorselessly .
this is odd , given the global relations in which the rich west is seen as an exclusive residential neighbourhood .
do we want even more ?
do we really need so much growth or can we combat unemployment by other means ?
the lopsided emphasis on material goods is bound to have a detrimental effect on our society .
it stimulates egocentricity , social exclusion , a blurring of moral standards and moral decay .
the corruption of society eventually harms economic development .
on a positive note , attention is paid to the effects of an ageing population on the sustainability of government funds .
only since 1999 have both government expenditure and revenue fallen .
a further consolidation , a reduction in the debt burden , is desperately needed in many member states , so as to ensure that funds are available in future for health care and provision for old age .
taxes and social security contributions in the european union are high compared to the united states , but the picture changes fundamentally when we consider the sometimes extortionate insurance premiums which american citizens have to pay .
the amendments which aim to shift the tax burden from labour to the use of scarce raw materials and minerals receive our support .
after all , the kyoto agreement more than merits compliance .
mr president , i want to associate myself this morning with those people who have spoken in this debate and expressed some desire to challenge an atmosphere of complacency about the current state of the european economy .
i share the view expressed earlier by mrs mcnally that you can look to the united states and see that there has been investment in research .
i refer to the remarks made earlier by mr lipietz for the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
i am very pleased to engage in a debate with him over the next four years on this issue of market liberalisation .
the fact is that we have not yet seen the agreed market liberalisation within europe applied in some member states , not least his own .
i have a shared concern about the jobs of workers .
that is a structural reform we must drive through .
it is not just in that area .
we see that the wealthiest states within the european union continue to be the states that apply the strongest amount of state aid .
that is robbing the jobs of some of the poorer states who are represented here .
that is also one of the reasons why i do not share the view expressed by mr von wogau in relation to competition policy .
my concern , where decentralisation is concerned , is that there should not be a repatriation of competition policy .
mr president , over the past few days , the debate on a european economic government has gained momentum once again in different quarters .
it is evident that more economic management is required at european level , but it is not so evident that only the 11 euro zone countries or the ecofin council will need to take on that coordination .
at the lisbon summit , a decision was made precisely in favour of a wider socio-economic approach in which employment , economic reform and social cohesion are seen as being interrelated .
in my opinion , the key conclusion that was reached at that summit was that the european council will itself adopt an active , guiding and coordinating role .
each spring , our government leaders will discuss the socio-economic policy on the basis of an integrated progress report from the european commission .
unfortunately , spring had already started this year .
the text for the broad economic guidelines for 2000 had already been drafted , very much along established lines .
why did the commission not take more time and , in line with lisbon , draft the guidelines in an interdisciplinary manner , as prepared by the different dgs ?
why do we not let the commission continue with , and further develop , this type of cooperation , which also typified the preparatory work for lisbon , in a socio-economic field ?
that seems to me a highly interesting challenge for the commission &apos; s new secretary general , david o &apos;sullivan .
i would suggest taking into account conclusion 29 of the present report , which advocates a drastic renewal of the intellectual apparatus behind economic policy-making to bring it in line with the lisbon conclusions .
i would also like to make reference to the conclusions of this parliament &apos; s committee on employment and social affairs , compiled by mr cocilovo .
he proposes the drawing up of a single annual report on the economic and social state of the union , and one set of annual guidelines for sustainable growth , employment and social cohesion .
one additional suggestion i would like to make is to include the socio-economic forum , which is scheduled for next month , earlier on in the annual cycle , i.e. at the very beginning of the year .
at the moment , it is just tacked on at the end .
the commission &apos; s recommendation and report may be evaluated in the light of the euro system &apos; s most fundamental problems , and these are undeniably major and glaringly apparent .
i come from a country whose people enjoy the rare privilege of being consulted in connection with such far-reaching decisions as participation in the euro system .
among danes , there is a great deal of scepticism about , and opposition to , the national currency being swallowed up by the euro .
i have no doubt that this scepticism and opposition are shared by large and growing groups of the populations of the other member states , who are not being consulted .
i only have time to mention a couple of points .
the first is one which is extremely important to the whole problem surrounding the euro .
nobel prize-winner franco modigliani points out that , in his view , unemployment has certainly been used by the european central bank as an instrument of economic policy designed to control inflation .
this is a crucial point .
the other absolutely crucial point i would mention is directly connected with the subject of the current motion for a resolution : the political weakness of the euro system .
what is missing , of course , is a political superstructure for steering economic policy .
this is the background to the french government &apos; s proposal that the eu &apos; s euro system should be equipped with a form of proper economic government .
it is these political consequences which are so crucial to the issue of the danish people &apos; s consent .
i can predict that the question of whether or not the euro zone is to be enlarged to include denmark , sweden and great britain will be decided in denmark in the referendum on 28 september .
the scepticism i have expressed here continues to grow .
mr president , the katiforis report is no more than a mundane vindication of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the member states .
of its 29 paragraphs , 8 go in for approval and then 4 indulge in self-congratulation .
as far as the working population of the countries of the european union is concerned , there really is not much to be pleased about .
what use is the economic growth that the report boasts about , if it is only going to recommend - addressing employees of course - adopting a reasonable attitude in wage negotiations , going so far as to claim that the pension system must be radically revised with a view to protecting their financial position ?
this is one way of admitting that there is no place in this growth for employed workers or for retired workers .
once again , the council and the commission are acting as spokespersons for big business , asking parliament to sanction it .
if it is true , as the report states , that we have seen a return to growth , then it is all the more appalling that , throughout europe , only a tiny minority benefits from it .
we shall therefore be voting against this report .
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european union is having to compete with a series of challenges generated by globalisation and the creation of a new economy based on knowledge and new technologies .
the union &apos; s strategic goal for the forthcoming decade must be to ensure economic growth and free enterprise , without violating the social question , with guidelines based on competitiveness , sustainable development and the creation of new jobs .
on the subject of this last point , as the katiforis report stressed , there has been a slight fall in unemployment in europe , but unemployment is still unacceptably high , particularly as regards the level of unemployment among women and young people .
the situation appears worse in certain regions of southern europe , in particular in the south of italy , where 21.9 % of the workforce is unemployed , including 56.6 % of the 14-25 age group .
consequently , in my opinion , broad guidelines for economic growth and a rise in employment should include measures to render the european market more competitive and increase job flexibility .
in order to bring about sustainable growth , we need to finalise creation of the internal market and remove all the remaining barriers by liberalising those sectors which are not yet totally open to free competition , such as transport , gas , electricity and the postal services .
we need to facilitate public administration structural reform in the countries where excessive red tape is a barrier to private investment and bring the social protection and taxation systems into line with the requirements imposed by the new economic rules and with the constraints established by the stability and growth pact .
mr president , we do not support the commission &apos; s guidelines .
they are outdated and obsoleted by events and do not contain any prospect of a solution to the extremely serious problems which are both holding back economic development and , in particular , weighing down the citizens .
the acclaimed macroeconomic development for job creation is so tied up in the self-regulation of the free market that it has not yet created any jobs , rather it has destroyed stable jobs , while , in the worst of cases , contributing to keeping salaries low in precarious employment sectors .
this is not the way to fight unemployment , but it will heighten social poverty , increase the democratic deficit and feed public scepticism towards the democratic institutions .
mr president , firstly i would like to thank the rapporteur and the committee for their magnificent work , and all the speakers in today &apos; s debate for the additional ideas they have contributed , which will no doubt be useful to the commission and the debate in the council of ministers .
today , together with the broad guidelines for economic policies , other issues have been raised , particularly in relation to the euro .
when speaking of the euro , i would point out two things : firstly , i would ask that the problem be looked at in its entirety , not simply the exchange rate problem .
secondly , i would point out that the commission &apos; s position remains the same ; that is to say , clear growth and price stability must logically lead to an improvement in the euro .
this is not an issue we can go into today , but i wanted to make those points .
today , we are discussing in particular the broad guidelines for economic policies .
the new broad guidelines differ from previous ones in that they partially incorporate lisbon .
it has been said that they do not incorporate it fully .
this is true in the sense that lisbon is too close to the presentation of the broad guidelines and the bulk of the work had been done previously .
nevertheless , i believe that there were elements prior to lisbon which anticipated or foresaw what was going to happen there and which have been incorporated into the broad guidelines .
many of you have referred to the idea of full employment as a fundamental element .
full employment , according to the commission &apos; s initial document - which formed the basis of the lisbon decision - is something which can be achieved as long as the proposed policies are implemented .
the problem of full employment is patently one of our primary concerns .
we can put a figure on both our employment objectives as well as on what we take the expression &quot; full employment &quot; to mean , as some of you have suggested .
it all depends on what we consider the objectives to be .
it is absolutely essential , in speaking of these objectives , that we know whether they are political objectives or whether they represent the possibility of achieving certain economic results , as a consequence of the policies we implement .
in any event , i would say to those who are concerned about this issue that the quantitative and qualitative assessment of full employment will become more efficient when we implement the indicators relating to the different policies .
some speakers have shown a degree of concern about the commission &apos; s habitual proposals on the flexibility of the labour market .
in our view , this flexibility will lead to a better balance in supply and demand in the labour market .
it will therefore lead to more employment , but also - as we have always argued - greater quality of employment .
this is something we have regularly stressed .
the flexibility of the labour market involves many other things : we can talk about regulating working time , but also the removal of all the obstacles which currently stand in the way of employment , such as tax-related issues .
a major point of concern throughout this debate has been the development of investment .
the central element of these broad guidelines for economic policies is trying to increase the european union &apos; s potential for growth .
if we are not capable of doing so , it is blatantly obvious that the current positive growth forecasts of over 3 % will only last a relatively short amount of time and this trend will not be allowed to continue .
that is why public and private investment are absolutely essential .
since 1997 , investment has been increasing progressively .
on the contrary , i believe that since the stability pact has allowed for the rationalisation of public finances , it will bring greater public investment in the future .
i agree with the view that , in these new circumstances , an improvement in the quality of public finances must involve greater public investment . this is a point which the commission has highlighted in the different stability and convergence programmes and , clearly , it is a point which we must continue to stress .
some speakers have also mentioned the importance of research and development and the new economy .
this is one of the key elements of the broad guidelines , but i would like to remind you - as i always do - that the main point of the introduction of the new economy is to improve productivity , which is the element which is most likely to bring future growth .
i would like to make an additional comment on two points .
firstly , with regard to the interinstitutional agreement , which has been of concern to the commission , and secondly , the problems of greater coordination in the face of greater subsidiarity .
with regard to the interinstitutional agreement , this is clearly one of parliament &apos; s recurrent demands .
it is also true that its implementation raises legal problems , as well as problems relating to the status of its participants , but i believe that , in any event , we should be satisfied with the progress made this year .
i promised you some months ago , when we discussed this issue in the committee on economic and monetary affairs , that the commission would try to make the greatest possible progress with regard to its cooperation with parliament .
it does not take the form of an interinstitutional agreement , but the presentation of the document on the results of the broad guidelines for economic policies , which will permit a prior debate in parliament , seems to me to be a positive thing .
there are other more profound elements , such as the introduction of the idea of broader economic discussions , with the participation of parliament , and the famous entretiens économiques , which will , in the future , offer us new opportunities and ideas for our political debate .
in my opinion , the portuguese presidency &apos; s idea - which we support - of also establishing a debate with parliament on these issues , not at an institutional level as suggested by parliament , but of a different nature , is also clearly positive .
i believe that this is a good direction to take , and we must continue to cooperate in this regard in the future .
lastly , i would like to point out that something has been raised which may seem contradictory between those who argue for greater coordination of economic policies and those who argue for greater subsidiarity in the way these policies are applied .
as you all know , economic policies are the responsibility of the member states and , in this respect , subsidiarity is guaranteed .
in my opinion , the greatest possible coordination is essential .
i therefore argue that we should move ahead with the coordination of economic policies , making reference to the member states &apos; obligations .
i said that coordination is necessary , but i do not believe that this has to be incompatible with subsidiarity .
greater coordination and greater definition of global policies does not exclude , however , the existence of an additional margin for action on the part of the member states .
i would like to end my intervention by thanking you all for your contributions , your participation in the debate and for your majority support for the document presented .
stability and convergence programmes
the next item is the report ( a5-0108 / 2000 ) by mr pomés ruiz , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the annual assessment of the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes ( 2000 / 2041 ( ini ) ) .
mr president , commissioner , i am very happy to reiterate your closing words in the debate on subsidiarity or coordination .
i agree with you , commissioner , when you say that there is no contradiction between these two terms , and that they should both be perfectly achievable .
perhaps this debate , on the 11 stability plans presented by the countries participating in the euro and the four convergence plans , is a good time to review the harmonisation between the subsidiarity and coordination required by the introduction and future of the single currency .
this , therefore , is the flip-side of the debate which we have just held on the report by mr katiforis , and we must firstly begin to think about the instrument .
this is the first time that this parliament has debated the 15 plans presented by the member states .
i suspect that , in subsequent versions , the report will not be a single whole , but rather a detailed study will have to be made of the solutions , the weak and strong points , which this parliament detects in the economic policies proposed by the member states .
we are therefore going to ask for more detail in the plans which are submitted , in the structure of expenditure and also of income , paying particular attention to investments .
we would ask that the projections they make in the medium and long term take account of different scenarios relating to the development of interest rates , demographic development and other variables affecting the stability of our accounts in the long term .
we also ask in this regard - and i am returning to the debate on subsidiarity - for greater political commitment from the 15 national parliaments .
we believe that this is a task which falls to everyone , and not just to the european parliament .
turning to the report &apos; s proposals to the house , i am very pleased to note that all of the budgetary objectives established in previous programmes have been met , and even exceeded .
we therefore believe that , although budgetary consolidation must continue to be a priority , the economic environment - which has improved a lot - must offer us the possibility of speeding up consolidation and , at the same time , undertaking structural reforms in the medium term .
it is not acceptable for this relative economic boom to dissuade the member states from making decisions - sometimes difficult decisions - on structural reforms .
these include , firstly , labour reform , which we discussed earlier .
it is clear that not all the states have implemented the labour reforms which we consider appropriate .
it is also crucial that we liberalise the telecommunications and energy markets , and not all countries are doing so in the same way .
with regard to tax reform , we should welcome the reduction in the high level of taxes in france , germany , the netherlands and spain , and we should bear in mind that the high rate of unemployment often relates to the fact that we have high levels of tax .
in the long-term reforms , we should also include the serious problem of population .
in the programmes presented to us , we note that particular attention is given to the ageing of the population .
perhaps it is time that we insisted that member states resolve the demographic problem at source , through a suitable approach to both tax revenue policies and social expenditure , in order to protect families with children .
this is the way to tackle the problem at source , and not only its effects .
this is the only way we will prevent the old europe from becoming a decrepit europe .
mr president , the liberal group supports the rigorous and demanding report by mr pomés ruiz .
it lays out and highlights both the achievements and the shortcomings of the member states in the way the stability and convergence programmes are applied , which , as i mentioned in my previous intervention on the katiforis report , have brought satisfactory results for the whole of the european economy .
however , this current satisfactory situation must not mask a series of shortcomings and must lead to the implementation of the series of recommendations which the rapporteur , mr pomés ruiz , correctly makes in his report .
i would like to conclude by arguing - and i believe this is one of the conclusions we must draw from mr pomés ruiz &apos; s report - for greater coordination between the member states with regard to the implementation of these programmes .
i would therefore like to insist once again on the need for a genuine direction for economic and monetary policy at european union level .
- ( el ) ladies and gentlemen , the pomés ruiz report has the good fortune to assess the implementation of the stability and convergence programmes at a time when the economic climate has helped these programme achieve success .
the rapporteur complains that the objectives are more the result of higher than expected tax revenues and the favourable development of interest rates than of the member states &apos; own efforts .
this perception betrays a rather narrow-minded budgetary policy .
in my view , there is nothing reprehensible about being able to achieve balanced budgets through development rather than by imposing fasting and prayer on the member states .
it is something in addition to the stability pact .
this trend can also be seen from the reference to the fact that tax and social contributions in europe account for approximately 46 % of gdp , while in the usa and japan they only account for 30 % .
but they are higher in europe because we have a social state .
if mr pomés ruiz &apos; s group wishes to change the policy on the social state , it should table it clearly and not tack it on to the stability pact .
i did not find one single reference in the report which justified greece &apos; s being singled out , as mr karas has done , but i should like to say the following , now that the subject has been raised : it is irresponsible to say that inflation in greece has only fallen over recent months .
inflation has fallen over eight years from 18 % to 2 % , thanks to constant and unstinting effort .
i had hoped that we warranted more generous support for this tremendous effort , which has required sacrifices on the part of the greek people .
to say that greece will be unable to sustain the criteria , i am sorry , but that is prejudging the facts .
how do we know that they cannot be sustained in greece but they can be sustained in so many other countries of the european union ?
the greek people are determined to apply the criteria and they will show their determination in due course .
mr president , we support the main objective of the motion for a resolution under debate , that is , the need for consistently transparent budget regulation on the part of the individual member states in line with the objectives of the stability pact .
however , we feel that , precisely in consideration of these undertakings and in the light of the current situation , the precise nature of any interventions cannot be identified in advance just for the sake of efficient budget control .
in fact , in a context where there are varying degrees of interdependence between states , there are too many variables at work to be combined to produce more general indicators .
i refer to the constant pressure with regard to restricting welfare expenditure , structural reform of the labour market and privatisation of the telecommunications and energy sectors .
the most representative variable is certainly the time frames and contents of the treaty reforms and the process of constitutionalisation of the union , i.e. of a greater or lesser european political presence .
in the debate we have just held we rather confused the three elements .
i would essentially like to refer to the one which seems essential today , that of the stability pacts , although i will mention certain other points which have been raised .
however , i would like to remind him that , within the framework of subsidiarity , it falls to the member states to define their own stability and growth programmes .
the commission must judge them , but it is not our job to give instructions on this point .
nor is it our job to give instructions on the stability programmes or structural reforms , which you have mentioned .
these structural reforms in fact fall within the broad guidelines for economic policies .
however , there is a point - the third which you referred to - which lies between the world of structural reform and the tax obligations relating to the deficit and , above all , the stability of public finances , in particular with regard to debt .
i am referring to the demographic problem and specifically the ageing of the population .
it is true that this is much more than a purely financial problem , but this is the concern which we highlighted in lisbon .
we will present a report in may on this specific point , in which we intend to consider not only the nature of income but also the nature of expenditure as well as how the reduction in public deficit has been achieved and what instruments have been used .
these are instruments of a permanent nature which have the same characteristics in each of the member states .
we will also tackle the issue of our future obligations .
in many cases the member states have obligations which are not classed as debt , but which do , in fact , constitute debt in one form or another .
all of this will allow us to hold the debate which you have mentioned .
i believe that that will be the time to carry out this type of comparison in more depth .
having said this , i am grateful for the effort you have made to assess the work we have done .
i believe that the problems of stability and convergence are basically characterised - as you have correctly highlighted , mr pomés - by the fact that , firstly , the objectives set have been met ; secondly , because we are following the same line .
i said that i wanted to make a couple of additional comments on two points that have been raised concerning issues which are not strictly related to this report , but with the previous report .
mr karas referred to the greek problem and the problems of sustainability with regard to convergence criteria .
in the case of greece , exactly the same criteria were applied as in previous assessments .
i understand that concern , mentioned in the commission &apos; s report , about the sustainability of inflation , but i would also like to provide some information which may clarify the situation .
therefore , i believe that these concerns about greek inflation are sometimes excessive .
secondly , you will have to debate the problems relating to the amendments which you wish to raise in the pomés report .
thank you , commissioner .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
adoption of single currency by greece
mr president , greece will be the twelfth country to sign up to the euro .
greece does not have to beg to be allowed into the euro zone ; it is fully qualified to join the states that will introduce the euro as an effective and definitive means of payment in 2002 .
in greece , the economic convergence criteria have been met , as a result of a stabilisation policy implemented most consistently by the greek authorities since 1996 .
at the beginning of the 1990s , greece was considered the sick man of europe , economically speaking .
the rate of inflation exceeded 20 % .
the european union officially described the budgetary deficit as excessive .
the public sector was notoriously mismanaged . almost half of the public debt was due to on-going transfers from the state to public undertakings .
today , major international bodies such as the imf , the oecd , the commission and even the ecb generally speak very highly of the efforts which the greeks have made .
it must be noted that private operators have also discovered greece .
in recent years , it has become a significant net recipient of foreign capital .
the stock exchange has undergone rapid expansion .
international rating agencies have improved their rating for greek loans .
the situation is far from perfect , of course .
there are still problems , particularly regarding the restructuring of the public sector .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs stresses the following points .
greece must continue to make efforts in order to ensure that the progress achieved in terms of disinflation has a lasting effect .
the government must step up the anti-inflationist bias of the economic policy instruments available to it , particularly in the fields of the budget and income policy .
cooperation between the two sides of industry seems essential in order to maintain a situation of non-inflationary growth .
even if considerable progress has been achieved in terms of the implementation of structural reforms , greece must step up progress in the reforms which are still necessary , including the effective transposition of european legislation into national law .
parliament has been consulted , in the context of a political decision to be taken by the economic and financial affairs council , after deliberation by the forthcoming european council .
parliament &apos; s response can therefore only be a political one , in favour or against , like any final decision in a genuine democracy .
greece &apos; s entry into the euro zone does not entail any political risks .
greece is entitled and , indeed , obliged to join emu .
there are probably some economic risks but these are more significant for greece than for the countries in the euro zone .
in joining the euro zone , greece will be forced to maintain the culture of stability which has been established since 1996 , and this involves pursuing a responsible economic policy .
this has , however , already created a virtuous circle leading to sustainable , non-inflationist growth , proving that stability is not an end in itself but that it must serve the purpose of healthy growth .
the committee on economic and monetary affairs , by an overwhelming majority , therefore urges parliament to vote in favour of greece &apos; s accession to the euro zone in 2001 .
mr president , let me add a few more personal observations .
i should like to congratulate the danish and swedish governments on having decided to consult their citizens regarding accession to the single currency .
i hope that the results of these plebiscites will be favourable .
in the same way , i should like to see the united kingdom opt for the single currency in the very near future .
the shared objective of the fifteen member states to create a european union which is ever more closely bound , particularly comprising an area without internal borders , could not be achieved in full without a single currency .
the united kingdom , as one of the financial capitals of the world , will not be able to claim all the advantages of an ever more integrated european financial market unless it becomes part of it in its own right and takes on all the joint responsibilities and obligations required under economic and monetary union .
there are some members of parliament who will vote against my report tomorrow , or who will abstain .
some are opposed to the euro , as is their right , while others are attempting to make political capital out of the real concerns which our fellow citizens have regarding the dollar-euro exchange rate .
it must be stressed that the euro is a stable currency .
citizens &apos; purchasing power within the euro zone has remained virtually unchanged since inflation has been , and remains , at a very moderate level .
of course , the value of the euro has fallen in relation to the dollar and , to a lesser extent , in relation to the yen and the pound .
such fluctuations are inevitable in a floating exchange rate system .
even so , the euro has not become a weak currency .
in the last twenty years , the deutschmark has experienced much more extreme variations in relation to the dollar .
in 1985 , the dollar stood at 3.5 dm .
in order to reach such a low level in relation to the dollar , the rate of the euro would have to fall below 0.6 to the dollar .
some people claim that the financial markets do not value the euro because of europe &apos; s tardiness in implementing structural reforms .
what structural reforms did germany undertake after 1985 in order to ensure that the deutschmark returned to a rate of 1.7 or 1.8 dm to the dollar ?
the fact is , the economic position of the european union is very sound , and is much more favourable than it has been over the last decade .
the only grey area is a rate of unemployment which , although falling , is still excessive .
a return to full employment is certainly not calculated to please the financial markets most of all .
generally speaking , good news regarding employment makes the stock exchange nervous , as it makes them afraid of a rise in inflation .
financial markets operate according to their own particular logic .
they look for immediate returns , and currently this is a safer bet in the united states , particularly because of its higher interest rates .
this trend looks set to continue , as the federal reserve has just hiked up its interest rates .
with their sheep-like behaviour , however , the markets will ultimately come to realise , mr president , that , in the medium term , the euro will be a more secure currency than the dollar .
mr president , on behalf of the liberal group i would like to welcome greece into the euro and say that we shall certainly be voting in favour of greek membership .
for those other &apos; out &apos; countries , including my own , i very much hope that they will be able to join the euro soon .
i very much regret too that there are so few british conservatives here in the chamber today because it shows , with greece now the twelfth member of the euro zone , how far from reality british euroscepticism about the future of the currency is .
the euro has successfully delivered low inflation , rising growth , falling unemployment and protection for the euro zone economies from the ups and downs of the foreign exchanges .
indeed , the british perception of the euro as a failure , because of its fall against the dollar , simply misunderstands the whole project .
the key test of a currency is price stability within the economy , not the value of the currency against other currencies outside the economy .
on the test of internal stability , with inflation at less that 2 % and growth higher at 3.1 % in the euro zone than in britain , the euro is clearly succeeding .
indeed , research at the bank of tokyo-mitsubishi recently calculated the euro &apos; s value as if it had existed over the last few decades , weighting each predecessor currency &apos;s value to create a synthetic euro .
historically , that research found that the euro actually swooped between a high of usd 1.70 in december 1979 and a low of just usd 0.69 in february 1985 .
in other words , the euro could stay within its historic trading range and happily now either fall by a further 23 % or rise by 188 % .
certainly that synthetic euro included currencies such as the italian lira , but the same point applies even to the mighty german mark on its own .
if the euro is a weak currency , than the mark was positively anaemic .
it plunged to dem 3.45 against the dollar at the end of february 1985 , which is a third below its current rate of dem 2.16 to the dollar .
within three years , and a dollar crash , the mark was back to dem 1.57 during december 1987 .
- ( el ) mr president , the report under discussion contains accurate information and an objective assessment .
in all events , this moment is an historic moment for greece and , may i say , for europe too .
i hope that we shall see other such historic moments when other countries join and , even more so , when we proceed , as we must , with the policy to complete unification .
the euro restored politics to europe and it is incumbent upon us to pave the way so that politics in europe can be institutionalised and globalisation , which is progressing blindly , without any historical or political plan , can be politicised at a later date , through a unified europe ,
for greece and the other members of emu , the problem of sustainability is crucial .
the problem of whether or not they will be able to act together on economic policy , as if they had already achieved political unification , is a political problem par excellence .
it is a problem of development choices and changes and , of course , it is a problem of public finance management .
greece has a tax reform problem .
a large part of the economy pays no taxes and the basic taxes which exist in other member states do not exist in greece .
the average greek taxpayer pays more than other europeans but total tax revenues in greece are much lower as a percentage of gdp .
this structural change is pending , while our government is confining itself mainly to privatisation .
other important structural changes are also pending , such as the need to strengthen regional authorities and their financial independence , reorganise cooperatives in all sectors from the bottom up and liberalise and strengthen the social economy and the third sector .
these are the areas which need to be strengthened immediately if sustainability is to have a future .
mr president , the european parliament report on greece &apos; s adoption of the single currency on 1 january 2001 is remarkable , more by virtue of the political will it expresses to enlarge the euro zone than by its concern for technical exactitude .
it is , however , true that greece has made considerable efforts in order to meet the maastricht criteria and has achieved good progress , except in a few areas , such as public debt , but on that subject there are some countries within the euro zone that are doing no better .
these minor failings , which would have had little impact if the euro had been strong , are now liable , against the background of the euro &apos; s depreciation , where the slightest ambiguity serves to detract from the image of the single currency , to have a much more negative effect , for psychological reasons .
nonetheless , the european institutions did not feel that they should postpone greece &apos; s accession so as not to give the impression that they had anything to fear and , from that point of view , the position seems perfectly logical , albeit somewhat risky .
the union for a europe of nations group almost agrees with their conclusions , but as a result of a very different logical argument .
our initial impulse , obviously , would be to refrain from participating in a debate which a good number of us think is nothing to do with us .
but , on the other hand , we think that extending the euro zone may , in the end , provide the stimulus for beneficial reforms .
- ( el ) mr president , the council &apos; s legislative proposal on the adoption by greece of the single currency on 1 january 2001 is a positive proposal which responds to the objectives of the european union to strengthen social and economic cohesion through economic and monetary union .
the new democracy team within the european people &apos; s party has always vigorously supported the policies needed so that greece , which was outside the first round of member states , could honour the obligations needed in order to join the euro zone .
the truth is that greece now meets the convergence criteria , with the exception of the public debt criterion .
however , this also applied in the case of italy and belgium and greece should not suffer adverse discrimination in the present case .
in fact , economic development and convergence policies started in greece at the beginning of the 1990s , as both the commissioner and the representative of the european central bank stressed during the meeting of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , and they concern various governments and various political powers .
however , they are due mainly to the efforts of the greek people as a whole .
policies in greece need to focus today on further structural changes , while maintaining an anti-inflationary line , with the aim of achieving a real social market economy in conditions of healthy competition , so that greece can keep comfortably to the dublin stability and development pact .
emu will be a real success once it succeeds in uniting all the member states , far more member states such as sweden , where convergence is proceeding exceptionally well .
i hope that soon the verdict of the swedish people will take the completion of the euro zone one step further .
mr president , greece meets the convergence criteria according to the european commission &apos; s verdict , which is based on a very nominalistic interpretation .
every self-respecting economist knows that greece , despite the impressive achievements of the past couple of years , does not yet have inflation and government debt sufficiently under control or in order .
the greek government has major financial interests in an extensive number of government enterprises which are mostly loss making .
in 2001 , the derogation for the liberalisation of various sectors will lapse , at which point the large hidden government debt - half the size of the current one - will become public .
why did the commission not take these skeletons in the cupboard into consideration during the assessment ?
on 17 january last , the greek drachma was revalued by 2.5 % , mainly to push down inflationary trends .
at the moment , the short-term interest rate in greece is about 600 basic points above the european central bank &apos; s level .
participation from 1 january 2001 means that the short-term interest rate must come down by the end of this year at the latest .
as a result , the credit facility will expand considerably and greece will be unable to meet the inflation criterion .
why does the commission turn a blind eye to this ?
in the interests of the greek citizens and a more flexible development of the greek economy , we are forced to decline our support for this commission proposal .
- ( el ) mr president , i wish to thank the rapporteur for his serious and objective approach to greece &apos; s candidacy .
i wish to thank him because he dealt with us just as strictly as all the member states which preceded us in forming the single currency .
this is the biggest compliment which he could give a country which , for a while , gave the impression that its economy was on the slippery slope towards general disintegration .
the world has many examples of where such a slippery slope can lead ; however , there are relatively few examples of a country which has found the strength not only to stop but to reverse the decline and manage to satisfy the extremely stringent stability criteria of today &apos; s world .
this success is particularly significant because it was built on the basis of an economy which was not rich and not particularly strong .
we do not need you to remind us that the greek economy is weak .
we know it is .
for a nation to build monetary stability on such a basis requires greater effort and sacrifice than in a richer economy .
the fact that the greek people agreed to make these sacrifices is proof positive of their determination to break away once and for all , by their own efforts and taking advantage , of course , of the support of the european union , from the fate of economic backwardness .
and we shall make the same effort in the future , not because you are strict and we have to , but because it is in our interests to do so .
this effort is dictated by our wish to have a better standard of living , to run a modern economy and to prosper with the rest of europe .
we are here not because we wanted to conceal our weaknesses , but because we wanted to fight and we fought and we won .
no one should rejoice prematurely at the present vicissitudes of the single currency .
in joining , we have shown our trust in europe , in monetary union , in the prospect of economic unification and in the success of our common economic fate .
that is the meaning of greece &apos; s accession , that is the meaning of its acceptance .
europe has become stronger today , not weaker , as the result of greece &apos; s accession .
mr president , the commission &apos; s and the ecb &apos; s convergence report deals not only with the greek , but also with the swedish , convergence programme .
so too does mr goebbels &apos; report , even if the part about sweden is limited .
the swedish economy is doing well - very well .
mr goebbels also points this out .
in common with mr karas and mrs randzio-plath , he also issues a reminder that the eu would be that much stronger if all the member states were to participate in emu .
this is a timely reminder of something which is self-evidently the case .
if one is going to join the eu , one should not do so by halves .
this could have been brought out more clearly in the report .
the euro has provided greater stability .
this has benefited companies , especially small companies .
price competition has increased , and there has been greater transparency .
the euro is not weak . instead , it is the dollar which is extremely strong .
allow me to remind those countries outside the euro zone that there is a danger of their influence declining further .
last week , we learned that france &apos; s prime minister wants to see a euro 11 - soon a euro 12 - with more influence and power when it comes to economic and financial policy .
at present , the economy is on the way up in europe , but the clouds are gathering - in the united states and in europe .
you do not buy an umbrella once it has begun to rain . instead , you buy an umbrella when the sun is shining so that you are prepared for when the rain comes .
the euro provides europe with economic stability and competitiveness .
there are very strong economic and moral reasons why sweden should join emu .
sweden should also have an obligation to help increase europe &apos; s economic competitiveness .
i should therefore have liked to have seen my home country , sweden , being able to join with greece today .
- ( el ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , our reservations about greece &apos; s accession to emu are not a matter of principle ; they are based on actual facts , as regards both emu in general and the greek economy .
as far as emu in general is concerned , we are in favour of real economic and monetary union .
unfortunately , this union is only monetary , not economic .
it is mu , not emu .
we know that emu was created prematurely for political reasons which date back to the events of 1989 and 1990 , which is why the child , the euro , has been delivered early and is languishing in an incubator .
this is the opinion expressed by the nobel prize-winning economists friedman , tobin and modigliani .
the creation of emu was not preceded by an agreement on the economic policy which the member states had to follow .
only now are the commission and council trying to outline common policies for certain economic problems such as unemployment and competitiveness .
but the road is long and full of adventures , as the poet says .
the goebbels report tells us that parliament &apos; s reply cannot but be a political one and assures us that greece &apos; s accession to the euro zone does not involve any political risk .
however , the report adds that there are economic risks and that they are greater in the case of greece than in the case of other countries belonging to the euro zone .
we agree .
there is no danger to the economies of the other 14 member states .
of course , i have trouble understanding how anyone can distinguish so easily between political and economic risks , but we shall let that pass .
as far as greece is concerned , our reservations concern the economic risks mentioned in the report .
the sole aim of the economic policy pursued by greece over recent years has been to satisfy the convergence criteria .
efforts have focused on improving indicators , not real economic quantities .
the competitiveness of the economy has not improved and unemployment continues to rise . the structural changes needed have not been carried out and privatisation has been presented as the new panacea for development and prosperity .
wage differentials have been sacrificed to indicators and are increasing , and , as a result , the figures are doing well while the people are suffering , however .
in all honesty , the goebbels report says that , as regards convergence , all eu governments are required to produce results but are free to choose the means of achieving it .
it is therefore the greek government &apos; s choice of means which we object to .
the means chosen were neither economically suitable nor socially just .
the rich got richer and the poor got poorer .
in joining emu , we are jumping in at the deep end and hoping for the best .
mr president , firstly my congratulations to mr goebbels on a very professional report and an excellent presentation .
some government finances are indispensable prerequisites for economic stability and economic progress .
securing budgetary discipline strengthens price stability and creates conditions which are conducive to creating much needed employment within the territories of the union .
the stability and growth pact states provide the 15 member states of the union with a comprehensive surveillance procedure to monitor their budgetary policies .
the stability and growth pact calls for member states to reach , in the medium term , a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus .
it must also identify the adjustment pacts adopted to reduce the general government debt ratios .
the commission and parliament monitor submissions made by each member state of the union to ensure compliance with the stability and growth pact .
we must also remember that there are wider provisions for closer coordination of economic policies in general between the member states of the union .
the principle of the stability and growth pact is also a logical progression from the criteria laid down in maastricht for the member states to comply with economic conditions for participation within the new european single currency .
the one comment i would like to make about the state of the single european currency is : why do so many member states want to join such a regime ?
it is clear that greece will shortly join the existing 11 member states who are participating in the economic and monetary union , and i wish to congratulate greece on its economic recovery and wish it well in the future .
i welcome greece into the euro zone .
it is also clear that sweden and denmark will accede to the single european currency regime over the next couple of years .
the 290 million citizens within the existing 11 emu countries have the right to know what the european central bank intends to do to maintain and enhance the value of the euro now and into the future .
we shall adjourn the debate on mr goebbels &apos; s report , which will resume at 3 p.m. today , as we are now going to start the voting , which will run from 11.30 a.m. to noon .
it will be adjourned for a formal sitting and will resume immediately after the formal sitting .
i therefore urge the members not to leave the chamber at the end of the formal sitting .
agenda
in order to avoid debating the subject twice over , the rapporteur wishes to wait until the council &apos; s recommendation has been updated in order to draw up a new text .
the socialist group has therefore asked that this matter be referred to committee and that the item be removed from the agenda for next thursday .
are there any objections ?
madam president , it would be much more coherent and in keeping with our rules of procedure if we voted , as long as we hold the debate , on thursday evening or friday morning .
mr barón crespo , the problem is that the text is still not available in french , spanish and swedish , thus presenting a problem in terms of our rules of procedure .
that is why the bureau proposed this solution .
madam president , i respect what the presidency has said , but i have different information : that this morning all the versions are available .
i accept the president &apos; s words , but i must point out that there is some inconsistency here .
mr barón crespo , i quite understand your objection .
i am informed by our services that the other reason for making this proposal was related to the limited time the groups have to table amendments .
having said that , following your request , i suggest that we put to the house the sense of the proposal which i have just made .
perhaps mrs buitenweg can give us her opinion , as rapporteur ?
madam president , i would very much regret it if my report were to be taken off the agenda and if the vote were not to take place this week .
we have an agreement with all political groups in this parliament that we would accelerate proceedings for this directive .
this is necessary to put through this directive swiftly and within the time in which the portuguese presidency , which has shown exceptional commitment in this respect , is in office .
the council will be convening before our next plenary sitting .
this means that if we do not adopt a resolution here , the council will be unable to adopt its position either , and everything will be shelved long term .
i would like to point out that the group which has the most problems and seizes upon administrative issues as an excuse to postpone dealing with these , is also the group which voted against this report in the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs .
i therefore do not rule out other motives which might be at play here .
this has a bearing on the speed at which anti-discrimination can be translated into legislation in europe and at which people can therefore be protected from racial or ethnic discrimination , and i do not appreciate the fact that parliament is arguing in favour of postponing this protection .
ladies and gentlemen , i appreciate the importance of this discussion , but i propose entering the debate on the agenda for tomorrow , as the bureau wished .
i suggest that the conference of presidents or , at any event , the groups , should come to some agreement on the procedure to be adopted regarding voting after the debate , and that our final decision on the timing of the vote should be postponed until tomorrow .
may i take it that the various group presidents and members of parliament agree in principle , as i am afraid that if i give the floor to every member who requests it we shall be starting the whole debate up again ?
mr president , as you know , i am the co-rapporteur with mrs buitenweg on this important directive on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs .
i hope that you will rule that the vote , as per our agenda agreed on monday , will go ahead and i have two points to make to our colleagues in the ppe in that respect .
that deal with the council and with the portuguese presidency said that we would agree in this parliament this week prior to the council of ministers &apos; meeting in june .
if we fail to meet that commitment , what does that say to the racists ?
and my second point : we talk about the dignity of parliament .
what about the dignity of black and ethnic minority people subject to racial harassment , victimisation and discrimination ?
ladies and gentlemen , i should like to make things quite clear .
the debate is indeed going to take place as scheduled on the agenda and , like everyone in the house , i appreciate its importance .
nonetheless , i suggest that you accept my proposal , which is this : that the debate should take place as scheduled on the agenda and , tomorrow , the sovereign assembly , after consulting the groups , shall decide whether or not to vote on this report during the present part-session .
i think it would not be right to vote on it immediately .
madam president , i do not see why the conference of presidents should make the decision .
surely it is up to all of us here at the plenary sitting to decide whether or not the vote should take place during this part-session , not the conference of presidents ?
we wish to decide right here , either today or tomorrow , whether the vote on this directive and this report should take place this week . we do not wish to leave the decision to the conference of presidents .
mr cohn-bendit , i think you have not been listening to my suggestions carefully enough .
i did not suggest that the decision was referred to the conference of presidents , which does not have the authority to decide .
i suggested reconciling points of view within the groups and then tomorrow , in the house , discussing the timeliness of voting this week .
it goes without saying that only the plenary assembly has the right to make this decision .
i should now like to put an end to any further speeches on the subject , as i am afraid that discussing the matter ad infinitum is not going to lead to a clear decision .
i shall just give the floor to mrs ludford , whose group has not yet had an opportunity to comment .
madam president , i just wish to emphasise on behalf of the liberal group the desirability of debating and voting this report this week .
despite the short timetable for the consideration of this matter , it has been dealt with very fully in the committee on citizens &apos; freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs and there has been every opportunity for amendments to be tabled .
it is regrettable that there have been administrative delays in producing all the language versions .
however , i feel that there is a touch of opportunism in the ppe group &apos; s objections to a vote this week .
after all , if it were technically impossible , the services would never have proposed that it be voted on tomorrow .
therefore , we should debate and vote on it tomorrow ; otherwise there is a danger of obstruction by one group .
ladies and gentlemen , i put it to you that we decide as follows : we shall carry on the debate as scheduled on the agenda and tomorrow , the house will consider whether the vote should be retained as scheduled , after consultation with the various groups .
vote
mrs muscardini , i suppose you wanted to speak on the next item , but , quite frankly , i would urge you not to take the floor .
i cannot deprive you of your freedom of speech , however , but i do appeal to your sense of responsibility .
madam president , my responsibility is that i have worked in this parliament for 11 years and i have seen it deteriorate with every passing day .
i will not go back to the previous debate although i had requested the floor in order to speak on the previous matter .
i am afraid that this is not the first time that the presidency has ignored this area of the chamber and so i am going to speak on the house &apos; s agenda .
would the presidency please organise the secretariat and herself in such a way as to accord all members the same right to speak on the matters over which they wish to take the floor .
it is deplorable to talk of democracy and human rights and then not give members the right to read the texts in their own language or to speak in the chamber .

explanations of vote- gonzález álvarez report ( a5-0128 / 2000 )
madam president , i voted for the gonzález álvarez measure on the regulation on the monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars .
why am i in favour of this measure ?
it is , above all , &apos; old &apos; cars , the cars which have been in use for a number of years , which cause atmospheric pollution .
i call for monitoring of these &apos; old &apos; cars , to ensure that they are always in a state of good health and to prevent them from harming the earth &apos; s atmosphere .
i therefore support the use and preservation of pensioner cars as well .
- ( fr ) the gonzález álvarez report deals with reducing co2 emissions , a necessary goal , particularly with the fight against global warming at stake .
an objective like this would require europe to provide itself with effective resources in order to limit such emissions , either by binding standards , as is the case for other pollutants , or by incentives , with checks and penalties .
furthermore , the increase in the number of vehicles plays a major part in the increase in co2 emissions .
this aspect of the problem must be tackled as well , by implementing a transport development policy involving rail and waterway transport , combined transport , and public service which is capable of offering an effective alternative to the private car .
according to the explanatory statement , the commission is still at the stage of a &apos; monitoring scheme &apos; , i.e. collating statistics but without undertaking effective checks , and , apparently , excluding light commercial vehicles ( vans ) and heavy commercial vehicles ( trucks ) .
it is better than nothing , but not much !
despite its limitations , we nonetheless voted in favour of the gonzález álvarez report .
smet report ( a5-0129 / 2000 )
madam president , i voted for the report on the conciliation process concerning the organisation of working time , first and foremost in support of the article on doctors in training .
the doctors will need to have learnt their trade well , free from considerations of working time .
above all , however , my vote for the motion is an invitation to consider reducing not just the working time in a worker &apos; s day but the time he spends working over his entire lifetime .
it would , in fact , be appropriate for a person not to have to work for 80 years if he is going to live to be 90 years of age , but to work for a period of 30 years if he is going to live to be 60 or 70 .
madam president , i voted for the amendment of the directive on working times because this directive has been extended to include certain categories which had not been covered .
i refer , in particular , to categories of the transport sector .
furthermore , i hope that the approval of this directive will prompt a decision , at last , to approve the regulations on flight times and working times for pilots and cabin crew .
this is not solely a social matter of worker protection - although it does include this factor - but it is also a question of flight safety .
.
( el ) it is a fact that man &apos; s strength and capabilities are limited .
working times may be harmful to the physical and the mental health of both individuals and families , which is why working times need to be organised so that the safety and health of workers are not put at risk .
however , 7 million workers in the eu , in transport and fisheries and doctors in training are exempted from directive 104 / 93 / åc on the organisation of working time .
extending the directive is essential , but it is not enough .
the provisions proposed will be unable to protect the safety and health of workers effectively , given that there are still numerous exemptions and long transitional periods for implementing the directive .
we must also bear in mind that the original directive did not stipulate the length of a working day ( it stipulated a working week of 48 hours - an implied violation of the measure ) .
- ( nl ) my group eventually accepted the compromise reached by the conciliation committee to apply the working time directive to the excluded sectors .
it is now crucial that these sectors can , at long last , look forward to a regulation so that they too come under the scope of the directive .
we struggle greatly with the long transitional periods for the junior doctors sector .
after the directive enters into force , the member states have a total of nine years before they are obliged to have transposed the directive into national legislation .
under certain conditions , this period can be extended by another two or three years .
needless to say , we feel for the many member states which struggle with inadequate staffing levels in their health sector .
however , the member states have known for a long time that they will need to adapt to the working times directive in the long run .
it looks very much like this serious problem has been shelved , as a result of which , in our opinion , the arguments used to support the long transitional periods do not so much signify powerlessness as unwillingness .
in the light of the above , when this directive and the ensuing national legislation is implemented , close monitoring will be required to ensure that the weekly working hours for junior doctors meet the statutory standards .
- ( fr ) i can only recommend that this text be adopted , which is the product of a long and difficult conciliation process between the council , the commission and parliament .
this favourable vote is of capital importance as it concerns the health and safety of some 7 million workers in europe .
workers in the transport sector and offshore workers , sea fishermen and doctors in training will at last be entitled to benefit from european working hours regulations .
the nine-year period is to be subdivided as follows : a four-year transposition period and a five-year transition period .
in the first three years of the transition period , the number of weekly working hours shall not exceed 58 , or 56 during the last two years .
for some states , however , this sort of nine-year period will not be sufficient to carry out the necessary adjustments .
these states may therefore be permitted an additional period of two years .
the commission will make a statement on the notification of the relevant member state , after consulting employers and workers at european level , as well as representatives of the member states .
the notification , the opinion of the commission and , if this opinion is not acted upon , the member state &apos; s justification , shall be published in the oj and sent to the european parliament .
if there are specific problems , then the two-year period may be extended for a further year , but the member state must incorporate the procedure in full .
the maximum number of weekly working hours may not then exceed 52 .
.
( pt ) i have voted against this report because , as a doctor by profession , i think that the excessive working hours that it proposes for junior doctors are unacceptable .
- ( fr ) the text before you , after years of negotiations seeking to define the maximum limits for weekly working hours , is symbolic in more ways than one of the ambiguities and inadequacies of european social policy .
firstly , as regards the very principle of a european social policy , the treaty of maastricht restricts this to minimum social standards , and only on condition that they do not &quot; hold back small- and medium-sized undertakings &quot; .
these restrictions are no longer acceptable today .
that , then , is one urgent question to be raised for the forthcoming revision of the treaty .
ambiguities and inadequacies are , however , just as evident in the proposal before us .
are we sufficiently aware that , in 1994 , when the member states came to an agreement on the maximum 48-hour working week , they excluded several million workers , such as transport workers , offshore oil rig workers or junior doctors in training ?
mrs smet &apos; s proposal extends the general rule of 48 hours to some of these sectors .
it still does not , however , settle the matter of long-distance road haulage workers and puts forward a frankly ridiculous timescale for implementing the directive with regard to junior doctors !
the position of these doctors in training is similar in many countries : working weeks of 70 and 80 hours in conditions that are occasionally disgraceful and sometimes dangerous to patients .
the recent strike by junior doctors in france showed that such a situation was not acceptable , either for the doctors , the patients or the public health service .
please think about what this means exactly . the first doctors in training to benefit from these conditions have just started secondary school !
i do not know of a single other area - the euro , the free movement of persons , goods or capital - where a timescale of this order is tolerated .
in such circumstances , how can we expect the european union &apos; s social policy to be taken seriously ?
especially as the proposal divides this twelve year period into several distinct periods , each with their own rules for the maximum working week :
until 2004 there will be no change , there will be no restrictions on working hours ;
between 2004 and 2007 the maximum working week will be 58 hours ;
between 2007 and 2009 it will be 56 hours ;
between 2009 and 2012 it will be 52 hours .
in adopting this text we are sending out a worrying message .
this is the first directive on social matters to be adopted since the lisbon summit on employment . i would like to express the hope that the commission , parliament and the council will , at last , take european social policy more seriously .
social europe will not make progress , nor will it convince our countries &apos; citizens with proposals such as this .
roth-berendt report ( a5-0117 / 2000 )
madam president , i voted for the roth-behrendt report , although , as before , my vote in favour of the motion is also a call for improvement of european legislation in the field of the implementation of the precautionary principle .
what i mean is , right now , i can imagine farmers running along behind their cows - daisy or buttercup , maybe - and fussing over feeding them hay , fodder and products from their fields , whereas they may well not have had time to have their animal &apos; s health checked .
so let us combine practical action with a desire for improvement .
- ( fr ) i should like to express my satisfaction with the content of this report .
let me remind you that in presenting this proposal for a regulation , the commission is fulfilling the undertaking it gave in 1997 to the european parliament &apos; s temporary committee of inquiry to put forward measures for effectively monitoring transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( tses ) .
this proposal seeks to create a standard legal basis for the monitoring and prevention of tses , of whatever type , and for all animal-based products .
it incorporates all community regulations in force in the field of tses .
like the rapporteur , i endorse the general strategy adopted by the european commission , but i think the text before us needs tightening up in order to guarantee maximum consumer safety .
i have therefore supported the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .
i shall conclude by stressing the fact that the european parliament must continue to be involved , under the codecision procedure , in fundamental decisions on the prevention of tses .
- ( fr ) the problem under discussion this morning was first identified a long time ago .
this is why , when we contributed towards setting up the parliament &apos; s temporary committee of inquiry into bse , we pointed out most forcefully that any regulatory instrument should necessarily cover all transmissible spongiform encephalopathies .
why has it been necessary to wait so long to effect the necessary changes in the regulations ?
why is there this time lag between scientific discoveries and community proposals ?
fortunately , as far as the protection of the citizens is concerned , reactions at national level and in a number of member states were rather more rapid and effective , compared with the incredible slowness and the usual paradoxes of community bureaucracy .
let me remind you that some countries , in effect , in order to ensure consumer food safety , have had to deliberately contravene community regulations .
it is a perfectly good idea to make the use of rapid diagnostic tests more widespread .
they will be a significant component of bse monitoring at community level .
let us not , however , treat them like a universal panacea . these tests can only detect the affected prion protein above a certain level .
they are therefore no substitute for , in particular , the withdrawal of specific high-risk materials .
above all , it would be an outrage if member states which have set up a screening programme based on tests far stricter than the community programme were to be penalised , in terms of classification with regard to bse-related risks , in comparison with states which have confined themselves to the minimum community programme .
community regulations should never represent a brake on , or obstacle to , the action of member states that wish to offer their citizens more stringent protection .
savary report ( a5-0113 / 2000 )
this is not the purpose of today &apos; s report but , in view of debates we will have in future , i wished to state this publicly .
madam president , i voted for the measure contained within the savary report , on the trans-european conventional rail system .
how could i do otherwise ?
this is a clearly a matter in which the european union must intervene on account of the subsidiarity principle .
long-distance transport can only be regulated at european level .
nevertheless , there was room for improvement in this measure , but i hope that this will be achieved over the next few years .
we must give our support to the interoperability of european railways as a means of revitalising and developing the sector at international level , in order better to meet users &apos; needs , and also as an instrument for protecting the environment .
nevertheless , we do not feel that adequate solutions to the problems arising for those working in the sector as a result of this process have been provided in the texts before us .
savary report ( a5-0112 / 2000 )
madam president , i voted for the second savary report , which differs from the previous report in that it refers to a trans-european high-speed rail system .
high-speed links must , first and foremost , be designed for tourism , leisure and the enjoyment of all european citizens , especially the elderly , who would be avid travellers if conditions were more luxurious and rail travel a more pleasurable experience .
- i voted against the report on the trans-european high-speed system ( a5-0112 / 2000 ) .
it is most enlightening to compare the two reports presented by our colleague , mr savary , even if these documents have different legal bases .
the high-speed sector and the conventional rail system respond to quite different philosophies .
the former report received unanimous support in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .
only half of the members of the very same committee voted for the latter .
this fact is , in itself , expressive enough .
on the high-speed rail system report the environment committee , astonishingly , did not deliver any opinion , even if the environmental aspects are not mentioned in it at all .
it seems that most people in this house do not really care about the need to rebalance the different modes of transport in favour of the railways , to reach a significant rise in the volume of goods and passengers that nowadays overwhelmingly use the roads .
- ( fr ) first of all i should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work on the commission &apos; s report on the implementation and effects of directive 96 / 48 / ec concerning the interoperability of the trans-european high-speed rail system .
creating the technical conditions for the interoperability of the european railway networks involves harmonising , between the various networks , the many different systems and components involved in rail transport .
this report , drawn up pursuant to directive 96 / 48 / ce , gives an initial assessment of the progress made .
it must be noted that four years after the directive was adopted , not one single technical specification for interoperability ( tsi ) has been drawn up even though interoperability is deemed to be fundamental to the mobility of persons and the effectiveness of trans-european rail systems .
the majority of member states have not , to date , transposed the provisions of this directive into their national legislation .
we are a long way from debating the priority to be given to rail !
it would , however , be unfair to say that no progress has been made .
for one thing , a tripartite body , the eari ( european association for railway interoperability ) , has been set up and has undertaken the work of identifying and specifying existing technologies , components and procedures , which should culminate in two tsis in the near future .
moreover , the latest high-speed network investment projects , designed along the lines of thalys , have , for the first time , made efforts to achieve convergence and technical coherence .
even so , these achievements are still inadequate in terms of the issues at stake .
national disparities are a considerable obstacle to the development of rail transport in europe , in spite of the many advantages of this means of transport in terms of sustainable development , pollution and safety .
the figures speak for themselves : in 1970 , the railways had a 21 % share of the goods transport market ; today they have only 8.5 % .
the trend is the same for passengers , where the market share has dropped from 10 % in 1970 to 6 % .
where freight is concerned , the railways could quite easily disappear altogether from large areas of the goods transport market .
there is no doubt that the closure of large parts of the european network would lead to significant job losses .
it is therefore essential to give a fresh boost to interoperability .
( the sitting was suspended at 1.20 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m. )
adoption of single currency by greece ( continuation )
mr president , allow me first of all to congratulate greece on its extraordinary economic progress .
the commission has now concluded that greece fulfils all the convergence criteria .
i am convinced that parliament will take the same view .
it is quite an achievement to meet the convergence requirements and , at the same time , as greece is doing now , to achieve increases in growth and employment .
europe , especially the remaining convergence countries - sweden and greece - are now showing that it is fully possible to fulfil the stability requirements of the convergence process and still maintain a dynamic economy with growth and falling unemployment .
against that background , i have no reservations about recommending that greece join the euro zone as from 2001 .
sweden , too , fulfils the basic economic requirements .
the swedish economy is now one of europe &apos; s strongest , with low inflation , high growth and a balance of payments surplus .
however , sweden still does not fulfil all of the more formal requirements .
it has not joined the exchange rate mechanism ( erm ) and swedish legislation concerning the bank of sweden still does not completely fulfil the requirements of the treaty .
however , the swedish parliament has instituted a number of changes to the legislation concerning monetary policy in order to facilitate sweden joining the euro .
the remaining changes will be made when sweden actually applies to join the euro , partly by applying to join the erm .
i am very well aware of the implications of the treaty .
but in a euro-sceptic country like sweden , which still feels itself to be a new member state , there is a democratic imperative for a change as major as that of joining the euro to be preceded by a careful democratic process .
at the committee hearing , commissioner solbes declared that it is the individual country which applies to enter the erm .
where sweden &apos; s entry is concerned , it is therefore my and , as i understand it , the commission &apos; s judgement that to want full status in emu by entering the erm is to adopt a political position .
commissioner solbes said in the committee that he respects the swedish government &apos; s desire to allow the people to decide the question in a referendum .
we are therefore also grateful for the phrases in mr goebbels &apos; report in which he welcomes this democratic process .
i look forward to that day .
mr president , i would like to make a brief comment concerning sweden .
sweden joined the european union without an opt-out , certainly not in respect of monetary union .
only on points such as legislation , which is in sweden &apos; s remit , does the country not meet the criteria .
there is talk of a referendum coming up .
i would like to know when exactly that will be as i am sure there is not a date for this yet .
how long will it be before the commission does its duty and reminds sweden &apos; s social democratic government of its signature under a very important contract ?
the swedish government sets an extremely bad example for the candidate countries which are , at this moment , waiting to join .
mr president , i would now like to move on to greece .
i have a problem with that country .
the greeks have produced a fantastic achievement .
i only wonder how long the effects of that achievement will last .
but i am acutely aware that by punishing greece for achieving something positive , we will let the actual guilty party off the hook .
greece probably does not meet the criteria any more or less than other countries did .
the euro zone should be able to carry a relatively small economy such as the greek one quite easily .
at the moment , however , this sends out the wrong psychological message to the markets and citizens who , to use an appropriate metaphor , look upon the euro descending mount olympus with sadness in their eyes .
this is why parliament , on behalf of the citizen , has to send out a signal to the union &apos; s large member states .
but the central bank , for example , is not concerned with the euro &apos; s external value .
the true culprits are the governments of germany , france , belgium and especially italy .
these countries , however , are making a mess of their own responsibilities vis-à-vis the currency and vis-à-vis the european citizen , let alone their own citizens .
they do not introduce the required structural reform within their own markets .
governments are far too accommodating when agreements are not met , under the motto : you meet the agreements today , i might meet them tomorrow .
why is italy not called to task when it makes a shambles of its good intentions ?
the large member states and belgium are trifling with the interests of all european citizens .
it is said time and again that the european citizens are not adversely affected as long as they stay in europe .
but surely , mr president , we should not make that decision for them ?
in the netherlands , many farmers are emigrating to north america .
a weak euro lets them down badly .
businesses within the european union have become 25 % cheaper for the united states to buy .
i think it is time for some changes .
i will be abstaining from the votes today .
mr president , i am wholly and unequivocally in favour of greece &apos; s adoption of the single european currency , the euro .
as mr goebbels stated in his report , the european parliament &apos; s task is not to assess practical adherence to the maastricht criteria , for that has already been done , item by item , by the commission and the bodies whose task it is to monitor these indicators and keep us informed .
the european parliament must express a political opinion ; it must speak from the heart and not on the basis of figures ; it must listen to its soul instead of numbers .
what sort of european union is it in which one of the 15 states , which wishes to accede to the most committed and most important level of european cohesion , is still left standing outside the door ?
when , as the report maintains , we consider that all the maastricht criteria are fulfilled and that , in addition , this country is called greece - an enchanting name in itself - we cannot fail to realise that this cannot continue and be moved to remedy the situation .
and i refer , in particular , to the greek pensioners .
you may wonder why , as representative of the italian pensioners &apos; party , i am interested in greek pensioners .
mr president , the euro was born two years ago .
for me , as a europhile , it was a great day when monetary union was brought to a successful conclusion , exactly as planned and with as many as 11 member states .
for me , as a swede , it was disappointing that swedish social democracy had not been able to deliver a result then and there .
now , two years have gone by - without any response or progress on sweden &apos; s part .
we are , unfortunately , the country without an emu strategy .
for my part , i can only congratulate greece as the twelfth country to adopt the euro .
now that our discussions are focusing upon greece and we are carefully picking over the greek economy , all eu countries ought to join greece in also adopting the euro .
many people are to be heard explaining the fall in value of the euro with reference to the fact that the united states &apos; s economy is stronger than europe &apos; s .
that is indisputable .
it is amazing , however , that more is not being done by europe to reverse this trend .
for me , the reason for this is clear .
there is a lack of confidence in the european governments .
it is time to implement the structural changes which are often talked about but which are still not being carried out .
with lower taxes and a more flexible labour market , europe can enter the new economy .
there needs to be more rationalisation of the budget , more exposure to competition , more deregulation and a more rapid phasing-out of monopolies .
if the governments of europe give priority to this work , we shall immediately find confidence in the euro increasing .
but many of the eu &apos; s social democratic-led governments are visibly unable to take action .
there is a lack of leadership .
it is not the president of the ecb who can &apos; talk up &apos; the euro . instead , it is the member states which can make the eu and the euro competitive .
mr president , i would like to thank mr goebbels for his report and also the various participants in this debate .
today we are studying the report on convergence , which deals with the swedish and greek problems .
with regard to sweden , the situation has hardly changed since 1998 .
the economic situation is positive , but the legislative adaptation of its central bank is not being carried out and it is not a member of the exchange rate mechanism of the ems .
with regard to greece , the situation is radically different .
greece did not fulfil the convergence criteria in 1998 but now it does .
by that i mean that it fulfils them in the strictest sense , using exactly the same criteria as in 1998 .
greece has clearly made a great effort and i therefore have nothing to add to the positive results highlighted by mr goebbels in his report .
i would like to talk about some of the points which have been mentioned today , given the concern about the greek model .
i understand that concern because greece offers a precedent not only for the new candidate countries but also for the current member states who , in the future , may join the single currency .
in this respect , it is quite clear that the way we deal with greece will be crucial but i want to insist that greece has been treated in the same way as all the other countries when their situation was considered back in 1998 .
there have basically been two issues of concern : debt and inflation .
are they sustainable ?
is this inflation situation sustainable , or durable , as you call it ?
in the case of greece , debt stands at more than 100 % of gdp , practically the same as in belgium or italy .
i do not think it is reasonable to compare the current situation in greece with that prevailing in italy or belgium .
we must not forget that belgium and italy have benefited from the fall in debt resulting from the reduction in interest rates , which is due , in particular , to the approximation of the interest rates of their central banks with those of the european central bank .
in comparative terms , the greek situation is similar to the italian or belgian situation at the time of their accession to the single currency .
the second point of concern is inflation .
with regard to the first point , concerning whether greece has achieved this inflation rate in a manner which is unsustainable , i must make a few comments .
greece has been complying with the inflation criteria for some months and the situation is improving considerably .
this morning i had the opportunity to discuss the greek figures which were issued a few days ago by the greek national statistical service .
the eurostat figures were also published this morning .
in comparative terms , therefore , greece &apos; s current situation is quite sound .
if we abide by the strict criterion of the last 12 months , we will see that inflation currently stands at 2 % . this is clearly better than the situation in spain and ireland , and practically the same as italy , luxembourg or the netherlands .
therefore , in terms of figures , i believe that we should not worry about the greek situation .
however , the commission also shares the concern which certain meps have highlighted .
we have therefore insisted on two points in discussing both the broad guidelines for economic policies and the convergence report .
i am convinced that all of that will happen , and the greek government has committed itself to ensuring that it does .
i therefore believe that the entry of greece into the euro will help rather than hinder it .
the euro has shown that it is still an attractive currency which some countries want to join .
i hope that the path being taken by greece will be followed by other member states in the next few years .
this is the end of a process .
we must wait for its culmination with the decisions in june , but i am convinced that , by welcoming greece into the euro when the time is right , we will generate more confidence in the face of any other type of arguments against the future progress of the single currency .
mr president , i have asked the commissioner when he will do his duty as far as sweden is concerned and remind the social democratic government of a signature which was placed here by sweden .
when will the commission enforce the treaty ?
the commission always respects the treaty .
it is obliged to comply with it . please do not forget that it is a fact that sweden is not participating because its central bank has not adapted to the european requirements , a decision which falls to the swedish authorities .
secondly , we should not forget either that participation in the exchange rate mechanism of the ems is a voluntary decision .
you may ask whether this is contrary to the spirit of the treaty of maastricht , but it is clearly not a point which we can debate at the moment .
thank you very much , commissioner solbes mira .
the debate is closed .
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 noon .
transparency of financial relations between member states and public undertakings
mr president , article 86 of the treaty captures the very essence of the resolution .
paragraph 1 stipulates that in the case of public undertakings and undertakings to which member states grant special or exclusive rights , member states shall neither enact nor maintain in force any measure contrary to the rules contained in this treaty .
paragraph 2 adds , in summary , that undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest shall be subject to the rules contained in this treaty .
it is up to the commission to monitor the observation of this article and to provide fitting directives or decisions to the member states .
the amendment to the directive to which this resolution pertains must enable the commission to carry out this task more effectively , which is certainly necessary given the ever growing liberalisation of recent years .
public undertakings and former public undertakings increasingly embrace the commercial world where they , partly with government funding , engage in competition with private undertakings , i.e. their own citizens .
let it be clear , then , that the much desired level playing field no longer exists .
the present situation promotes money wasting , distorts international trade and , as such , forms a threat to the internal market .
it is surely only logical and reasonable that public undertakings , at the time when they enter into the market , should abide by the same rules as private undertakings .
these are the considerations with regard to the proposal .
in short , what is the origin of investments in the commercial field ?
initially , the commission proposal met with a great deal of resistance from emac and the commission .
in actual fact , there was only a handful of ppe-de members and the liberal group who were in favour of the planned transparency .
this caused me concern .
we , as meps , are elected to exercise democratic control over the executive , in this case the commission .
the commission is , in turn , responsible for observing article 86 .
we thus have the duty to ensure that the commission carries out the assigned task properly but , at the same time , some of us would prevent it from doing exactly that .
i wonder how we must come across in a situation like this .
we make it abundantly clear that we strive for fair competition and utilisation of our internal market but , when the chips are down , we are once again looking solely after our own interests .
in the report on the adoption of the single currency by greece , i blame the governments for not doing what needs to be done .
those against this directive are thus giving the governments a helping hand .
as parliament , we cannot do anything else but to ensure that the markets operate clearly and transparently and that we do not give preferential treatment to certain undertakings and not others .
this directive may seem tedious , but is , in reality , the acid test .
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to make three points regarding this directive , and the consultation , on which i should like to congratulate our rapporteur .
i think she has managed to come up with a reasonable balance within our committee in what almost became , on occasions , an ideological debate .
in your proposal , commissioner , you quite rightly exclude a number of sectors , and we can only be pleased at this .
secondly , as our rapporteur pointed out , i should like to draw attention to the fact that the jurisdiction of member states in this field must not be disregarded .
at the present time , there is no definition of services of general economic interest at european union level .
we must therefore bring subsidiarity into play , and we are well aware that in such areas , national sensibilities may be expressed in diverse ways .
i would urge mrs peijs to read again the latest version of the treaty with regard to what she considers to be the last word on the law on competition within the european union .
my third observation , commissioner , is on public broadcasting services .
once again , i cannot ignore what we incorporated into our treaty when we amended it in amsterdam .
this sector is very clearly covered by specific conditions .
this shows the determination of the member states to treat this sector as a sector in its own right falling outside the rules of competition which exist in other areas .
i just wanted to complain about the quality of sound reproduction .
there is a bad echo in the chamber , as a result of which we can hardly hear those speaking in their original languages .
can something be done about this ?
we will try to resolve the problem you have raised in your speech , mrs maes .
mr president , the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party welcomes the commission &apos; s proposal , which will lead to increased public scrutiny of public undertakings and to increased competition .
we want to thank mrs randzio-plath for cooperating so well .
state aid distorts competition and is unfair to both consumers and companies .
in principle , the treaty prohibits all types of state aid , including cross-subsidies .
the treaty does not , however , prohibit the existence of public undertakings providing services in the public interest .
whatever one may think about this , it is for the member states themselves to define what is meant by services in the public interest .
the member states should not , however , themselves decide what kinds of aid they will be granting these undertakings .
the court of first instance in luxembourg stated as late as last week that state support for tv and radio companies may only be provided once the commission has said that this is compatible with the treaty .
the rules must be applied in the same way to all parties .
all aid which is not used to finance services in the public interest is prohibited and is to be opposed .
state radio stations and tv companies now often provide services which are outside the scope of what we call services in the public interest .
an example is internet connection .
those resources which the state has injected into companies to finance their basic activities ought not , of course , to be used to finance the provision of internet connections .
in that case , competition is distorted , to the disadvantage both of consumers and of private companies .
the commission &apos; s proposal requires companies to openly account for the resources provided to them as public undertakings and for how these have been used .
companies must also show what costs they have , where their income comes from and how this is derived from their various activities .
these are very reasonable demands .
both these obligations are simple means of upholding the rules governing relations between private and public undertakings .
this is important for the purpose of maintaining proper rules in the internal market .
mr president , commissioner monti , on the subject of the proposal before us , i should like to make four remarks or observations on behalf of my group , but not without first congratulating our fellow member , mrs randzio-plath .
first of all , i should like to thank commissioner monti for having had the courtesy to consult the european parliament .
a commission directive has been referred to us , even though , i believe , it is not legally mandatory to consult parliament , although the subject is clearly a crucial one .
this leads me to reiterate the hope that the forthcoming intergovernmental conference will propose subjecting all legislation on competition policy to the codecision procedure , thereby enabling us legally to work on a more equal footing .
my second comment concerns the actual purpose of this proposed directive .
it has an extremely specific aim , which is to prevent , subject to monitoring by the commission , any legitimate public aid to services of general interest being misappropriated to the benefit of activities which are themselves open to competition .
having said that , the problem is by no means easy to solve , as the previous speaker made clear .
one might go so far as to imagine , even if this is a matter for subsidiarity , that the community as such should at least define the minimum standards of what the universal service may be . otherwise we are heading towards a relatively chaotic situation .
thirdly , i should like to know the commission &apos; s reaction to recital no 4 of our report , in which the rapporteur and the committee on economic and monetary affairs effectively ask the commission to specify how important it considers services of general interest to be .
i await the commission &apos; s response on the matter .
fourthly and finally , there is one amendment , amendment no 3 , which is explicitly intended to exclude the broadcasting sector from the scope of the proposed directive .
i think this amendment is an improvement on the current text . paragraph 6 is a masterpiece of diplomatic language but is relatively incomprehensible .
i should therefore like to see the commission expressing its support for amendment no 3 as proposed in plenary .
mr president , i also wish to add my congratulations to mrs randzio-plath for the work on this report , which has been difficult at times .
this directive sets out to identify and prevent subsidies which distort competition .
in order to do this , the directive proposes to require public undertakings and private undertakings that perform public tasks to carry out separate accounting procedures .
i obviously agree with the rapporteur that competition rules must be applied rigorously in order to prevent cross-subsidies that go against the purpose of the aid .
