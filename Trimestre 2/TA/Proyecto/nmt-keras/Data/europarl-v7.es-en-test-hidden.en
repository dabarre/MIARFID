Now , more than ever before , there is a need for the countries of the region to choose the path of peace and to turn away from the path of violence and recrimination .
There is a need for governments to show leadership for peace , and to turn away from the politics of the last atrocity , which serve no one ’ s interest .
Elsewhere in the region , in Iraq the security situation remains a cause of grave concern .
It is disturbing that recent attacks have aimed at maximising civilian casualties and have been intended to promote sectarian violence .
A secure , democratic and peaceful Iraq , within its present borders , can exert a positive influence for peace and stability across the entire region .
The European Union looks forward to the transition to a representative Iraqi administration and is committed to working with the people of Iraq in securing a peaceful and stable future for that country .
There is a pressing need for action to address the various problems and challenges to peace and prosperity throughout the Middle East .
I believe that the European Union is ideally placed to make a contribution in support of this objective .
Historically , the European Union has enjoyed a close relationship with the countries of the southern Mediterranean and the Middle East , built up through centuries of intertwined history , commerce and exchange .
We are not strangers to each other .
Indeed , through Euromed and the Barcelona Process , the Union has enjoyed a structured relationship with countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean for ten years .
The Barcelona framework is comprehensive in scope – covering political , economic , social and security issues of mutual interest .
It commits us to working towards a shared zone of peace , prosperity and progress .
In the economic sphere we are working towards the establishment of a free trade zone with a market of 700 million people by 2010 .
The possibilities offered by this vast market will lead to a growth in employment , prosperity and stability right across the partnership .
The Union has also concluded Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with all but one of the Euromed countries , and I hope that the negotiations with the remaining country will be concluded soon so that the grid of arrangements can be completed .
I would urge all partners to expedite ratification of these agreements , which are an important instrument in developing economic relationships between the European Union and the Mediterranean countries .
An important element of our engagement has also been to promote democracy , good governance and the rule of law .
This is in line with the conclusions drawn by the 2002 UNDP Arab Human Development Report .
Significant funding has already been made available by the Commission in support of programmes which promote these objectives .
The Union has also developed a framework of cooperation and dialogue with the countries of the Gulf through the Gulf Cooperation Council .
At present we are working with our partners in the GCC to achieve a free trade agreement .
Although negotiations have been long , and at times difficult , they are now moving in the right direction .
In addition we are considering ways to develop relationships with Yemen and Libya , and reflecting on our relationship with Iran .
It is clear that the Union already has a deep and close relationship with the countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East .
It is one based on partnership and dialogue , and on a willingness to work together to address the challenges facing the region .
It is also a relationship that is based on the recognition of the strategic importance which each represents to the other .
We are their neighbours just as they are our neighbours , and it is in our shared interest to see a zone of security , prosperity and progress develop across the wider region .
In recognition of the importance of the region to Europe , the European Union is currently working to develop a Strategic Partnership with the Middle East and the Mediterranean following a mandate from the European Council in December 2003 .
This is also a key objective of the European Security Strategy , again adopted in December 2003 .
Security and stability is a shared interest of the countries of the region and of the European Union .
We need to do more to address the causes of instability which afflict the region – causes which include lack of economic development , under-developed educational opportunities and the need to promote open societies and economies .
Our primary objective is to promote the development , through partnership , of a common zone of peace , prosperity and progress across the Mediterranean and into the Middle East .
The goal is to enjoy close and cooperative relations with all the countries of the region , responding as far as possible to initiatives from within the region itself .
Resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict is a strategic priority .
However , reform in the region should not be conditional on progress in the Middle East Peace Process – or vice versa – but both objects should be pursued in tandem .
This is the context that informed the adoption of the interim report presented to last week ’ s General Affairs and External Relations Council and endorsed by the European Council .
The interim report proposes an EU Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East .
It is also essential that the impetus for reform comes from within .
There is already much being done , both at governmental level and by civil society .
It is for the region itself to work out an appropriate way forward .
Equally , there can be no &apos; one-size-fits-all &apos; solution to the challenges facing the region .
We are actively consulting with partners in the region who are our key interlocutors .
This will be an essential element in preparing our final report for the European Council in June .
In this spirit , the Taoiseach , Mr Ahern , in his capacity as President of the European Council , had planned to address the Arab League Summit in Tunis yesterday , as a further step in our intensified consultations with the region .
But , as I have already noted , that meeting was cancelled .
Foreign Minister Cowen is currently in the region , holding a series of meetings with key interlocutors .
The presidency &apos;s commitment to consultation and dialogue remains absolute .
We will continue this process at the forthcoming Euro-Mediterranean Partnership Mid-Term Ministerial Meeting to be held in Dublin and at the Ministerial Meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council .
I have already commented on the need for progress in the Middle East Peace Process .
There can be no long-term solution in the region without the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict which has cost so many lives on all sides .
Implementation of the Quartet Roadmap remains the basis for reaching a lasting comprehensive settlement resulting in two viable , sovereign and independent states , Israel and Palestine , living side by side in peace and security .
As members of the Quartet , we will continue to work towards this end .
Acts of violence by either side cannot contribute to advancing the political process necessary to reach such a settlement , and such acts , therefore , must be rejected .
The countries of the Mediterranean and the Middle East are facing a broad range of challenges politically , economically and socially .
Equally , those countries possess enormous potential which , if fulfilled , would result in benefits for all the peoples of the region .
Progress in all areas – economics , commerce , education , democracy and civil society – is essential if the conditions for lasting peace and stability across the region are to be achieved .
The European Union is committed to working as good neighbours with the governments and peoples of the region towards this end , which is in all our shared interests .
.
Mr President , may I first thank Parliament for making time for this debate .
I would like , however , to underline that we are not starting from scratch : rather , we are building on a comprehensive partnership with the Mediterranean countries and a set of bilateral relations with the countries east of Jordan .
We will continue to develop our partnership on the basis of these existing instruments .
I would add here that Europe is the most significant player in the region .
The Community now spends close to EUR 1 billion a year in the region in promoting economic reforms , sectoral reform , institutional and political reform and in supporting sustainable development across the region , including our specific funds for supporting the Palestinians and for the reconstruction of Iraq .
If one adds in the lending from the European Investment Bank , it makes a total of around EUR 2.5 billion a year .
Furthermore , the European Union is the biggest trading partner for every country in the region except Jordan .
So with this level of involvement , why has economic development and political reform been so slow to take off around the Mediterranean ?
Why is the human development gap still so great ?
But secondly , and crucially , it is important to remember that the Barcelona process was formulated in an atmosphere of optimism , in the aftermath of the Oslo agreements .
Stalemate in the peace process in the Middle East has time and again stymied progress on reform .
Recent events are another sad but powerful confirmation that , as our report put it , it will not be possible to build a common zone of peace , prosperity and progress unless a just and lasting settlement of the conflict is in place .
Once again – and I am afraid I have had to say this all too often in speeches in this Chamber – we stand before the smoking ruins of the peace process .
And this at a time when we had some hope of movement : the cancelled Arab League Summit was expected to provide a positive impetus to the peace process by relaunching its Beirut peace initiative .
How , I wonder – and I expect this question comes to the minds of many honourable Members – has Sheikh Yassin &apos;s assassination helped to improve the security of the Israeli people ?
How has it contributed to even the stated goal of a peaceful and consensual withdrawal from Gaza ?
I thought , and I still hope , that we had already seen the worst of the atrocities carried out by suicide bombers .
But what we have witnessed lately is wickedness beyond imagination : for example , a frightened adolescent , explosives strapped to his body , is told that he will go to heaven and is sent out to kill himself and others at a military checkpoint .
It is despicable and it is cowardly .
What kind of world have we created when 12-year-olds are out on murder missions like that rather than playing football or doing their homework ?
And what are the circumstances ?
What is the environment that creates this culture of death and murderous recrimination ?
My broader point is that if we are serious about wanting reform in the Arab World then , as the European Security Strategy states , resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict remains a strategic priority .
It is what philosophers would call a necessary but not sufficient condition .
Progress cannot be a pre-condition for confronting the challenges of reform , nor vice versa .
But to attempt one without the other is , in my view , only too likely to prove a recipe for failure on both counts .
I regret , then , that the Arab League summit could not take place as planned , not least because it was expected to adopt a common declaration on domestic reform which would have been an important staging post in developing our common agenda .
But working in this part of the world means , almost by definition , that one has to remain hopeful , so I hope that our Arab partners will be able to come together again soon .
We are certainly prepared to do what we can to help .
I also believe that we now have a European Union position which we can take into consultations with the region with some confidence of generating new momentum in our relations with our Mediterranean and Middle Eastern neighbours .
Insofar as that is true , we are very grateful to the Irish presidency for the creative work it has done , both intellectually and diplomatically .
I also hope that our friends across the Atlantic are recognising that our long-term , consensus-building approach has some value , based , as it is , on building common agendas that respect differences of approach in different countries and regions .
The Greater Middle East initiative from the United States generated controversy in the region , mainly because the objectives appeared to have been set without any real consultation process with the region .
In the furore surrounding this , few paid attention to the substance .
In content , what they are suggesting could involve the development of American policy towards the region based on the kind of comprehensive and long-term engagement which we have been advocating and trying to implement for many years .
We have much to talk about with officials in Washington if they are prepared to match this commitment with appropriate levels of resources .
Time will tell , but whatever the results , the European Union should focus on developing its own strategic partnership with the region .
If we are successful , I believe we can make a significant contribution to fighting terrorism in Europe and in the region , one that is as important as the proposals to strengthen the European Union &apos;s internal security that I know will be discussed by Parliament tomorrow .
It will take us another step down the road towards a central objective of the EU ’ s Security Strategy , namely : &apos; to promote a ring of well-governed countries … on the borders of the Mediterranean with whom we can enjoy close and cooperative relations &apos; .
I make one final point which builds on what I have just said .
There are many things we have to do internally .
There are many things we have to do in the areas of police and judicial cooperation .
I have no doubt whatsoever that one of the most important things we have to do is to work more energetically , more creatively , day and night , to try to bring peace to the Middle East .
The conflict does not justify anything any terrorist ever does and a number of terrorists and those who support terrorists use the plight of Palestinians and use the position in the Middle East as a wicked justification for the misery and mayhem they create .
That is true .
It is also true that one should not appease terrorism .
It is true that there are important security aspects involved .
But we all recognise as well that to bring peace to the Middle East would remove one of the causes of alienation in country after country which helps to provide a breeding ground for terrorism and for the murderous ideas that terrorists espouse .
So I hope that we will be able to work more enthusiastically and more successfully to bring peace to the Middle East , and that the beneficiaries of that peace will not only be the people of Israel and the people of Palestine , but the people of Europe and the wider world as well .
It might be useful for me to point out to colleagues – as I did last week to the Conference of Presidents – that last week in Athens we successfully co-launched a partnership : the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly .
Indeed , it builds precisely on the long-term perspective mentioned in the last two speeches .
It is a partnership of 240 Members of Parliament : 120 from the partner states and the southern shore of the Mediterranean , 120 from the EU national parliaments and the European Parliament .
We have still to fill in the personnel , but we have established the outline of the bureaux and the composition of three working committees which will prepare future parliamentary assembly work – a Political Affairs Committee , an Economic Affairs Committee and a Social Affairs and Cultural Exchange Committee .
It is an important parliamentary aspect and a good platform to build on .
Unfortunately , the timing was such that both of the speakers here today – the Council and the Commission – were tied up with the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels preparing the summit meeting and were unable to participate .
Both institutions acknowledged the launch of this Assembly and both wished it well .
We need as a Parliament to ensure that future meetings are arranged at a time to enable the Council and the Commission to participate , because the parliamentary part is , and can be , an invaluable long-term development and communications platform .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , last Monday 22 March , there took place in Athens the inaugural session of this Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly , of whose future importance in relations on both sides of the Mediterranean President Cox just reminded us .
Still reeling from the shock of the images of 11 March in Madrid , it was on the morning of 22 March that we learned , President Cox , of the assassination of Sheikh Yassin , with all the consequences this could have .
Let us therefore resolve to have more influence in the negotiations in progress within the Quartet , since we well know – as you said , Commissioner Patten – that Europe can and must now play a decisive role there .
Whether or not we wanted it to be , the United States is considered , rightly or wrongly , to have taken Israel ’ s side .
Russia does not have the same interests as ourselves , stemming from our geographical proximity to the region , and the United Nations does not have our means to act .
If we Europeans were finally to speak with the powerful voice expected of us , there is no doubt it would be heard .
I am sure that the will to do so exists in our Parliament , as this debate will once again prove , quite simply because it reflects the will of a very large majority of our fellow European citizens .
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr Commissioner , can we begin to hope that this will might finally manifest itself other than through pious wishes ?
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this is a grave hour at which we must work even harder to break the infernal spiral of violence in the Middle East .
Although Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was not one of our best friends , his assassination is a clear and flagrant violation of international law .
They could have arrested him and tried him .
I would also point out that we have created an International Criminal Court which must have a role to play , although it is not supported by some States , including Israel .
We roundly condemn the assassination of the Hamas leader and other Palestinians , on the direct orders of a government , the government of Israel .
We also roundly condemn the murders and terrorist acts aimed against the civilian populations of both parties to the conflict and I believe we must appeal to the Palestinians not to respond with a murderous increase in terrorist acts and more bloodshed .
This assassination has already had very grave consequences , including the suspension of the Arab League Summit .
In this regard , I would like to express my agreement with the severe judgment of Shimon Peres in the Knesset when he said that this action would bring even more serious consequences .
There must therefore be an end to this policy of continuing to build the wall within the occupied territories , of ordering extra-judicial executions and , furthermore , there must be a withdrawal from Gaza , to which the current Israeli Government has clearly committed itself .
We do not want to go that far , but we believe that we must issue a solemn and severe warning .
In this regard , I would like to make three requests : the first is to urge Israeli civil society , that vibrant Israeli society , and all its political parties , while defending its right to its own security , to demand that its government act in accordance with international law .
Thirdly , that the Commission continue with its aid , with the European Union ’ s aid , to assist the Palestinian National Authority to be strengthened and reformed , because a strong interlocutor is required if we are to argue that there must be a Palestinian State .
I believe that the whole of this process must come within the framework of the proposals being made to resolve the problem of the Middle East .
It is clear that in order to resolve such a bitter and profound conflict , it is better to propose peace than to begin new wars and increase the cycle of violence , above all in a situation in which the stability of those regimes which could contribute to supporting a process of reform is being broken .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Patten , the nightmare in the Middle East seems never to end .
Like everyone else , my group feels extremely frustrated and powerless at our not being able to do more to solve this bloody conflict that is the cause of so much suffering .
In the last few days , we have been talking a lot about terrorism and , clearly , nothing would mean more in the fight against terrorism than peace in the Middle East .
The situation there is the source of huge frustration and fanaticism , and it inculcates into young people a feeling of hopelessness and despair that creates a breeding ground for recruiting suicide bombers who are themselves also very young .
Two states – recognised by one another , democratic and existing side by side – would naturally have an enormously positive effect on stability throughout the region .
Plans , projects , conferences and new initiatives – it feels as though we have tried everything .
There is no lack of creativity when it comes to the Middle East .
We need no more initiatives . We need political will , a desire really to sit down , negotiate and achieve peace .
Unfortunately , there is nothing to suggest that today ’ s leaders , whether in Israel or Palestine , have this will .
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party condemns the murder of Sheik Yassin .
It was contrary to international law .
Assassination may appear logical from a military point of view , but it is the worst of diplomatic means .
Yassin had odious crimes on his conscience . He has never recognised Israel ’ s right to exist .
In all respects , he was a loathsome terrorist .
Nonetheless , we cannot accept this type of killing .
It must be possible to make higher demands of a democratic state such as Israel .
Hamas has now been given a new martyr and thousands of people burning with the desire for revenge .
The Palestinian leadership must therefore show unprecedented strength and leadership in order to prevent a new spiral of violence .
Arafat must emphasise that it is not Hamas that is setting the agenda .
The ELDR Group cannot be too emphatic in its condemnation of the suicide bombers .
This senseless killing of civilians , innocent children , women and men is paralysing the Israeli people and making the slightest errand or social excursion fraught with mortal danger .
The fact that ever younger teenagers and children are now being recruited as suicide bombers is the most repellent form of terrorism of all and can never ever be explained or excused .
Israel and Palestine must return to the negotiating table and to the Quartet ’ s Road Map .
I wish to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten for their work to bring this about .
We must obtain an end to the violence , and the Palestinian Authority must once and for all recognise Israel ’ s right to exist .
For its part , Israel must stop building the Security Wall , which is condemned by the whole world .
Walls can never be the solution .
The previously promised and announced withdrawal from Gaza must also begin .
Peace in the Middle East and a peaceful Iraq in which I hope that the UN can be given a greater role would be very great progress and would have huge significance for the process of reform throughout the region .
If , in the way that has been sketched out in the proposal now adopted , we succeed in incorporating these countries into a close and extensive network of trade and cooperation , it would constitute huge progress for the EU .
The collapse of the Arab League summit is tragic , but there is yet hope that reference will still be made to human rights and democracy , which are the places from which we have to begin .
Finally , Mr President , I just want to raise another issue about which the ELDR Group feels uneasy , and that is the riots in Syria in which hundreds of Kurds have recently been killed .
Many are imprisoned , and there are reports of members of this group being tortured following riots a week ago .
I hope that the Council and the Commission can step up the pressure on Syria to put a stop to this killing .
– There is no doubt – and it is an obvious thing to say – that the conflicts in the Middle East are becoming more tragic by the day .
We cannot evade this problem , and I agree with the President-in-Office of the Council and with Commissioner Patten , that the Palestine-Israel question is central and essential to it .
I also think we should abandon our conformist position and stop saying that the Palestinians do not recognise the State of Israel : they recognised it in 1988 .
It is not true that the Palestinian Authority does not want to negotiate : it is continually saying that it is prepared to negotiate .
The one who is rejecting negotiation , the one who really is following a different policy is Ariel Sharon .
I believe we should assess the matter objectively .
There is no doubt that the Palestinian Authority bears responsibility for its own inability to stop terrorist acts , but I also think we should clearly assess to what extent Ariel Sharon ’ s policy has brought on the growth in terrorism .
Mr Patten is right : it does not mean that terrorist acts in themselves , irrespective of the policies that are being implemented , should be condemned and suppressed .
Let us stop telling ourselves that they are all birds of a feather .
There are differences , and these differences are the ban on and the failure to implement any international rights for the Palestinians .
Let us now think about that great plan , rather than a working paper , that the United States has prepared for the G8 Summit in June .
In fact it is an arrogant , imperialist project and , although it provides for the development of democracy , democratic processes , preambles , aid and support , it does so without any discussion with anybody .
We cannot export democracy – apart from the fact that we should begin to think about our own democracies – since democracy is a continuous process in which we too are inadequate , in which we too sometimes have gaps and differences .
As it has been put forward , the Greater Middle East initiative is a plan that will certainly not help the growth of democracy .
It will probably help some accomplice or subservient regimes , but it will not contribute to the reconstruction of Arab countries that do in fact need to free themselves from oppressive regimes and really need democracy .
Not with arrogance and imperialism , however , please !
I think the European Union ’ s decision to opt for the long term and not to aim for immediate results by cutting the Gordian knot of old is the right one .
We therefore need time to reflect and to build relationships .
In this sense , the Parliamentary Assembly organised in Athens is important : we have seen the differences and the diversity of the Arab world as well , and not just its weaknesses .
I should like to return for a moment to Ariel Sharon ’ s policy .
In 1973 , when Winston Churchill ’ s grandson asked him what was to become of the Palestinians , he answered that there was no need to worry : ‘ We ’ ll make a pastrami sandwich of them . ’
He would crush them in a sandwich .
That is what he is doing by building the wall and preventing freedom of movement .
Sheikh Yassin ’ s assassination was not the first : there have been 250 extrajudicial executions , and the first victim was Tabet Tabet , an Al Fatah pacifist who was working with Peace Now .
Why , though , do we always have to keep repeating and reiterating these things ?
I sometimes get tired of repeating myself and feeling that everyone bears the same responsibility .
That is what is so terrible .
Four days ago I was in the mountains of Kurdistan and saw demonstrations in Van for Sheikh Yassin .
That is the risk we are running ; that is what President Bush has done .
Finally , I also agree with the proposals put forward by Mr Barón Crespo on Article 2 and the other items .
Mr President , it is of course only right that the European Council should condemn Israel ’ s unlawful execution of the Hamas leader , Sheik Yassin .
Why , as General Morillon said , are there , however , only words and pious wishes ?
Why not back our words with action ?
The EU has , of course , practical and unique opportunities to punish Israel through the Association Agreement .
As early as May 2002 , we considered , here in the European Parliament , that it was the last straw when it came to Israeli human rights violations , and we demanded then that the Association Agreement be suspended .
Why does the Council not listen to Parliament ?
Moreover , the European Commission has expressed itself along the same lines as Parliament .
At the most recent meeting of the Association Council , the Commission produced a long list of Israel ’ s infringements of human rights and of UN decisions .
At that time , the Commission warned that the EU would subsequently have to review its position if there were no improvement .
Moreover , we are concerned here with trade policy pure and simple .
Fraud of this kind , involving the rules of the trade agreement , is on its own enough to justify suspending the Association Agreement .
Why all these words ?
Why no action ?
What is more , we know that Israel has nuclear weapons and , according to the experts , probably still more weapons of mass destruction .
Clearly , Israel is allowed to have them but , when others acquire them too , they are bombed back into the Stone Age .
Why is action not taken against Israel ?
The least that can be asked is that we repeal and suspend the Association Agreement , just as the European Parliament has requested .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that what is currently happening in the Middle East is very different from what we might have thought until a few days ago .
In fact , I believe that the Middle East is gradually getting closer and is even right on our doorstep .
We can see this in speeches with which , in some cases , I could not disagree more , such as Mrs Morgantini ’ s speech , but not just hers .
Indeed , I believe that the terrorist attacks that we are witnessing within Europe must be taken into account .
We cannot suddenly just consider the issue of the murder of Sheikh Yassin .
As a Catholic , I reject any idea of one day hitting someone : not killing them , but just hitting them .
In my opinion , this is not , however , the point .
I believe that if we want to guarantee our citizens peace , tranquillity and serenity in the future , we need to draw up a very different proposal and follow very different lines of thinking .
Europe , as such , cannot just be a mouthpiece for a message in terms of European funding for the Middle East area .
Europe must put forward a genuine and specific proposal .
I believe that this can be done , and in this case I appeal to Commissioner Patten and the Irish Council Presidency to call for an end to the conflicts .
I believe that this could once again give politics a real voice and not just an issue on which to speculate in this Chamber .
For those who , like me , have experienced terrorism – a different type of terrorism , ‘ red terrorism ’ – and have seen a bomb in the house and a brother get out through a window , political words meant nothing at the time , in the eighties .
The answer that we found – as a young person at the time – was unique and truly incredible : there was a unity in purpose to achieve a single objective : to combat terrorism .
I believe that this can only be done if we , as Europe , are aware of this and at the very least now compile a list of terrorist associations to be assessed at an international level .
I believe that everything else is just idle chitchat .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , what the Council has told us does not , in my opinion , add much that is new to a European position which , beyond endlessly recited hollow phrases such as ‘ Mediterranean cooperation with a view to peace and prosperity in the region ’ , is totally inconsistent .
In reality , the Union plays no role at all in the Middle East , apart from as a provider of funds and , more often than not , one acting in the dark , too .
Politically , we do nothing , however .
We could , however , play a role if we left behind our European divisions , something that is no doubt impossible , and if we had the courage clearly to take a side .
It is not a matter of taking one of the two obvious , and old , sides in the Middle East conflict , with the Israelis on the one hand and the Palestinians on the other .
This debate is outdated .
The choice we must make concerns the current real divide , which pits the moderates against the extremists on both sides .
The United States does not make this choice .
It even does the exact opposite and sides with the moderates and extremists by turns .
Furthermore , it very often sides with the extremists , whether they be the fundamentalist Muslims or Israeli religious extremists .
It does this in accordance with the interest it has in dividing the region in order to rule it better .
Now , Europe ’ s interest lies specifically in reuniting the region in order better to make a success of the forms of Mediterranean cooperation that will make the Mediterranean what it always was , that is to say the geopolitical centre of the world .
France ’ s policy is the exact opposite of that of the United States .
France resolutely sides with moderate Palestinians and Israelis on both sides .
This is why , alone in the face of the United States , it is the other major power present in the Middle East .
Alas , apart from France , Europe is too divided , so that we are reduced to the feeble words we have just heard from the Council .
It is a shame , but it is not surprising .
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner Patten , the European Union has , then , rediscovered its ‘ sacred union ’ by condemning the killing of Sheikh Yassin , and some have even presented him as a venerable old man and an almost saintly person .
Today , in this Parliament , we have heard the party chairman Mr Barón Crespo authoritatively , and others I believe somewhat less authoritatively , remind us of the possibility of calling for Article 2 to be applied , that is to say the suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel because of the death of Sheikh Yassin .
His death is certainly a violation of international legality ; there is no doubt about it .
The European Council dedicated five paragraphs to condemning Israel for this , but I do not recall having read anything in the text about employing handicapped children for just a few euros to turn them into human bombs with 10 kg of explosives .
We Radical Members have called for the suspension of the Association Agreements – as Commissioner Patten knows only too well – under Article 2 , which unfortunately we have never , or almost never , put into practice , for scores of countries , many of them also in the region .
I believe that it is important not to lose sight of this fact .
As regards the issue of the Greater Middle East , for example , it is true that the Americans have been over-ingenuous , putting forward this proposal without allowing it to be scrutinised and assessed perhaps more attentively and being put first and foremost to the governments of the Middle East .
This is , therefore , the way to resolve – or to include – the Israel-Palestine issue too in a more overall solution .
To conclude , I applaud the fact that the major leaders of the European left finally recognise , as we have been saying for 30 years , that the accession of Israel and Palestine to the European Union is another important path towards reaching a lasting solution to the Middle East issue .
– It is perfectly fine by me , Mr President , for me to be the first to keep exactly to his allotted time .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I do not think we should play the same narrow-minded game here at every sitting , raising again the supply of goods from the West Bank to the European Union .
There is nothing wrong in discussing the matter , and last time we had a full debate about it .
If those goods were supplied by the Palestinians , they would enjoy the same European Union preferences and it is therefore pointless to always encumber such a serious question as this conflict with such banalities .
Secondly , everyone in this Parliament condemns the illegal executions that Israel is carrying out .
They are incompatible with international law and there is no need at all to discuss the matter . It is good that we as a European Union are making that absolutely clear .
Many Americans are also saying that it is wrong .
That is why we should not always be setting France against the USA in the matter .
Henry Kissinger , too , said that quite clearly at the weekend .
What we must do , however , is something that demands rather more : we must now engage in dialogue with the Arab world .
We must also be clearer in reminding our partners south of the Mediterranean of our fundamental convictions if we want to reach a comprehensive solution .
Those who are normally always very vociferous about these things in this House should also be vociferous in addressing the Arab world about them .
We do that with Israel . It is a democracy .
We can expect a lot of it , and I believe we are right to do so .
We should , however , develop a broader perspective on the Middle East . That also requires a dialogue with the Arab world about our fundamental principles .
Otherwise , we will never find a solution .
Mr President , the most detailed and in-depth analysis of the limits to the development of democracy in the Arab world and of its consequences on development in those societies came from the first report of the United Nations Development Programme that was drawn up in 2002 .
The second report was published recently and goes into more depth as regards the lack of education and training , the severe limits in terms of cultural production , technology and research .
The most revealing fact is that the team that is working on this project is made up entirely – and I repeat , entirely – of Arab researchers .
The strategy for the Greater Middle East , drawn up by the Bush administration , is based largely on these analyses , with a limitation that I would say is fatal : that of prescribing changes and reforms without establishing any relationship with the Arab and Islamic world .
There is the risk that this approach will fuel the notion that so-called Western civilisation thinks itself superior to all the religious and cultural traditions of the Arab world .
This notion lies at the root of the feeling of humiliation that is so widespread in these countries and which terrorist groups exploit , hoping in turn to fuel hatred towards the West .
The second comment that I would like to make concerns relations between the Bush administration and the Sharon government .
In the eyes of the Arab world , the principle of double standards is intolerable .
Can Sharon ’ s Israel still be defined as a country under the rule of law despite the extrajudicial executions , collective punishments , the construction of a wall in Palestinian territory , the settlements and the lack of access to fundamental resources such as water for the Palestinian people ?
The US administration , so inflexible that it inflicted two wars on Iraq and ten years of embargo , today is not budging an inch on what was once again defined as a humanitarian disaster by the rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva yesterday .
Europe has a role and a responsibility in all of this , but also a solid history of relations in the Mediterranean area , based on a different method , that of partnership .
Recently this strategy was stepped up , as a response to enlargement to the East , with the neighbourhood policy .
Mr President , Europe is strongly committed to peace but is deeply frustrated by the latest terrorist attacks .
For Europe , the Mediterranean is a crucial area , an historic challenge and until it is transformed into an area of peace , development , democracy and stability , Europe will not , I am sorry to say , be able to fulfil its potential .
Today the conflict between Israel and Palestine is erasing any glimmer of hope and the worsening of the conflict is certainly not helping to combat international terrorism , indeed in ideological terms it is fuelling it .
In order to ensure a future of peace in this area , however , greater responsibility is needed and all our efforts , our political authority and our financial and human resources must be used to ensure that we get back on the road to negotiations .
The Athens Forum was therefore an important step , but this is not about supporting one side or the other .
The route that we must take , even now that hopes for peace seem almost dead , remains that of working towards a clear objective : two states , one alongside the other , Israel and Palestine , that live in peace and security without discrimination and with respect for human rights .
To this end , Europe must hold constant and open dialogue with the whole of the Arab world .
Mr President , as the whole world has affirmed , the assassination of Sheikh Yassin by the Israeli army is a totally irresponsible provocation .
Having participated in the establishment and development of Hamas with , at the time , the intention of weakening the PLO , the Israeli powers today seek to torpedo any idea of a peaceful solution .
Faced with this policy that is suicidal for both the Palestinians and the Israelis , the call by sixty key Palestinian figures to refrain from avenging the death of the Hamas leader is extremely dignified and courageous .
In short , by matching words with action in the interests of respect for international law .
Any other approach is bound to fail and cannot be taken seriously under any circumstances , especially by Arab countries .
While the American president continues to encourage Sharon , welcoming him in a few days ’ time , the Union can no longer hide behind words .
In a totally different spirit to the American plans for a Greater Middle East serving only their economic and strategic interests , Europe must finally take action if it wants to realise the ambition declared in Barcelona of bringing about a region of peace and prosperity .
The proven lies concerning the reasons for armed intervention in Iraq and the new boost given to terrorism extending also into Europe drive us to take initiatives much bolder than those implied by what the Council and the Commission have told us today .
An end to the occupation and the recognition of a sovereign and viable Palestinian State would also deprive the terrorists of a fertile breeding ground .
It is peace in the region and throughout the world that is at stake .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , after Madrid , the threat of a clash between the Western and Islamic worlds is drawing nearer .
Will we simply let this happen ?
Both in Israel and among the Palestinians , there are forces pursuing mutual destruction .
After all , what else can a so-called military solution amount to ?
Sheikh Yassin did not want peace on the basis of negotiations , but does Sharon ?
On several occasions , Sharon provoked Palestinian violence , most recently with the military occupation of Palestine , the erection of the wall and the assassination of Yassin .
This violence was continuously breeding more violence .
It is a source of frustration , so much so that the export of the conflict to other areas is moving ever closer and is becoming a threat to world peace and to safety in our cities .
That is why we are asking you to shift your peace efforts up a gear , to cancel the association agreement and not to delay starting the debate on an international peace force in Israel .
Only the right to self-determination can really provide a peaceful outcome .
Mr President , the best conflict prevention measure is respect for human rights .
Unfortunately , Sharon does not even remotely live up to this respect .
It is detrimental to every peace effort that the international community is allowing Sharon constantly to violate international rules .
To condemn Israel is not enough : measures need to be taken .
The EU could begin by suspending the trade agreements .
Clearly Israel is entitled to protect its citizens against terror attacks , but Sharon &apos;s persisting violations of human rights , including extrajudicial killings , are not protecting but endangering its citizens .
It is contrary to international law ; it totally undermines the very concept of the rule of law , which is a key element in the fight against terrorism .
Israel could easily arrest suspected terrorists , instead of killing innocent passers-by , of whom many are women and children , using exactly the same despicable means as suicide bombers .
The Palestinian Authority cannot stop suicide bombings when Israel deliberately fuels everything that leads to them , thus sharing the responsibility for them .
In many cases , Israel has used extrajudicial killings against exactly those Palestinian leaders who have been strong advocates for peace and for stopping the suicide bombings .
Sharon &apos;s state terrorism is no substitute for political negotiations such as the Geneva Accord and the roadmap , which Israel is now abandoning .
Mr President , the Middle East is the spiritual home of the three great revealed religions of the world , but sadly also the inspiration for those misguided few who invoke Islam as a justification for terrorist killings , invoking in particular the bloodthirsty traditions of Salafism and Wahhabism .
The Middle East is a source of vital oil supplies to the West and the location of one of the longest and bloodiest disputes between the Arab world and Israel .
It is also the location of some of the most ruthless regimes , ranging from the old Iraq of Saddam to the current government of Iran .
Saudi Arabia is also brutal in its decapitations for misdemeanours , like alcohol consumption .
The Middle East is a source of many of the EU &apos;s refugees , particularly from Kurdistan , and if we allow Turkey into the EU , the EU &apos;s borders will stretch into the Middle East to face Syria , Iraq and Iran directly .
Therefore stabilising this region in peace , democracy , good governance with the rule of law and respect for human rights is essential to the EU &apos;s interest , as well as the people there who have suffered under tyrannical governments for so long .
That is why I support the roadmap for peace , for a two-state solution in Israel and in Palestine , for a democratic Palestine alongside the State of Israel .
But I remain critical of the fact that EU money was given in direct budgetary assistance without adequate safeguards to prevent diversion of funds to corrupt practice and possibly even terrorism in a theatre of war and in a zone where such practice is commonplace : this , I believe , was wrong .
Tomorrow , Parliament &apos;s working group looking at this will regrettably be publishing two separate reports .
I have always supported and continue to support the liberation of Iraq from Ba &apos;athist tyranny and remain optimistic that eventually we will see a new Iraq emerge which will serve as a catalyst for democratic change elsewhere in the region .
Lastly , I hope to see more dialogue between moderate Muslim leaders and the EU &apos;s political classes if we are to avoid the much feared clash of civilisations as a scenario .
Mr President , referring to the Mediterranean and the Middle East , the Council has just indicated – and I quote – ‘ the Union ’ s willingness to work with the United States for the purposes of cooperation in the region ’ .
It would be no bad thing , in my view , if Washington did the same and expressed its fervent desire to cooperate with the Union .
I believe that this would involve the following : a sensitive , rather than blunt and brutal , drawing up and presentation of its proposed plan for the democratisation of the Middle East .
It would also involve objectives in line with reality and common sense , bearing in mind , in my opinion , that excessive ambitions , since we are talking about an area from Morocco to Pakistan , may lead to looking foolish , firstly , and then failure .
And , above all , I believe the United States should accept that it is impossible to confront such a vast enterprise , without treating the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict as a priority and prior objective .
Israel rejected the Saudi peace proposal , ratified in Beirut by the plenum of the Arab League , and has blocked – and let there be no mistake , it has blocked – the road map and decided to continue along its own unilateral course , which includes extra-judicial assassinations .
In my opinion – I would insist – these circumstances , together with the assassination of Sheikh Yassin , have led to the suspension of the new Arab Summit , scheduled for yesterday in Tunisia , and I believe that no possible initiative for a so-called ‘ Greater Middle East ’ can succeed in any way in this context .
If a moderate leader says what I have just quoted , the Union must take note of what this implies and take action as a consequence .
I will end , Mr President , by saying to Mr Laschet , who has just spoken – although I regret that he is not here – that I agree with him when he says that we must talk less about the extra-judicial assassinations violating international law , because we all condemn them .
The problem is that these assassinations take place , we all condemn them , but none of us act to put an end to them .
Mr President , I have two points .
While legally debatable , the execution of Sheikh Yassin must not cause us to forget who he was : the instigator of the worst suicide attacks and the head of a movement whose charter still calls for the destruction of Israel and , beyond that – let us not forget – the physical elimination of Jews throughout the world .
Do we mourn this man ?
Secondly , the American plan deserves some consideration since it invites us to move beyond the illusion in which European action is currently mired , the illusion whereby resolution of the conflict would precede the democratisation of the Middle East .
As we know , democracies do not wage war against each other , so there will be no lasting solution to the conflict without democratisation and modernisation of the Middle East .
Without such a Copernican revolution , Mr President , we will forever have the spectacle of a sententious but powerless Europe , which Commissioner Patten embodies with the perfection of an old Shakespearean actor .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the day after the creation of the EMPA , the European Union has , as everyone has said , a duty to become involved in peace building within the logic of the Barcelona process .
The Union bears a historic and political responsibility , and it can no longer content itself only with issuing condemnations when the region is ablaze or weeping when terrorism strikes .
Now , the United States tells us that it has a plan for the Middle East .
How , though , can we talk in terms of plans when we know that Syria has a presence in Lebanon , when the occupation in Iraq is ongoing and when a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has still not been found ?
This plan is , indeed , disputed and disputable .
It is disputed because the United States has not bothered to discuss it with the countries concerned . This clearly reveals America ’ s mistrust and their unilateral practices , just as the pre-emptive war in Iraq did .
It also reflects the geopolitical ignorance of the United States and the generalisations it makes by including Maghreb in the Middle East , and Pakistan and Afghanistan among the Arab countries .
Finally , what does this plan advocate ?
The fight against terrorism ?
Yes , but with the installation of American bases in the region .
Has not this been the case since 1990-1991 ?
Resolution of the conflict ?
Yes , but to be credible , it would be necessary to fight all forms of terrorism , including the state terrorism conducted by Israel , which is doggedly trying to exterminate the Palestinian people , yet with total impunity .
Lastly , democratic reforms ?
Certainly , yes , they are inevitable and essential , because the people are today suffering an economic , political and democratic deficit .
These reforms are needed , but so is economic development .
Finally , and in conclusion , only by reducing the gap between the ruling classes and the people will these reforms be possible .
Civil society must be involved .
It is for this reason that we in Europe must support the forces of progress or internal forces for peace and strengthen dialogue in order to dispel fears , to finally put an end to this violence and to let our common values govern us .
Mr President , Commissioner , anyone who fails to recognise that the State of Israel has the duty to protect its citizens against terror loses their credibility .
Ever since the Palestinian leadership started the second , two and a half years ago , in order to achieve their goals by violent means , nearly one thousand Israeli men , women and children have been killed by poisoned minds with shrapnel grenades around their waists .
Where is the Europe-wide indignation about the Palestinian leaders , who drape bombs around their children and , if they are detained by soldiers , are prepared to blow them up in cold blood ?
The biggest obstacle to peace in the Middle East is the Palestinians &apos; unwillingness to recognise the State of Israel .
There is no other explanation for Arafat &apos;s refusal at Camp David .
The State of Israel accounts for only 0.6 % of Arab territory .
For a long time , Arab nations thought they could drive the Jews into the sea by using the Palestinian refugees as a means of putting Israel under international pressure .
The Arab countries have never allowed their Palestinian brothers to lead a dignified existence .
The UN , too , kept the refugee status of the Palestinians artificially in place for 50 years .
King Abdullah &apos;s first reaction to a possible retreat of Israel from the Gaza was the fear that Palestinians would be looking for jobs in Jordan .
Peace is inextricably linked with justice , and that is where the problem lies .
On its own continent , Europe has placed democracy on a pedestal , but ignores democracy in Israel , in a region which consists of nothing but dictatorships – enlightened or not , as the case may be .
Mr President , the assassination of the Hamas chief had one effect , which was that the Arab League summit , which was to have taken place yesterday and today , was cancelled .
That is a tragedy because the summit was to have considered a number of proposals for reform in the Arab region .
I want to focus on this question of reform because that is fundamental to our security in the European Union .
The Irish Foreign Minister spoke about the Arab-Israeli conflict .
He also spoke about the evolution of democracy and civil society in these lands .
My question is , what can do ?
While Commissioner Patten spoke about the Barcelona process – a highly desirable process established a long time before the Americans &apos; idea of a greater Middle East process – that process is not having the sort of effect that it should have .
This sort of democratic odyssey is trying to establish one thing : the appetite of the peoples of the Arab countries for democracy , the rule of law , civil society and so on .
We know what our foreign policy priority is : we know it is human rights , it is democracy , the promotion of fundamental freedoms and the rule of law .
But in this arc of instability on our rim , while the EU is spending EUR 700 million plus in MEDA funds , only EUR 7 million of that is being spent on democracy .
I find myself caught between the Scylla of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Council and the Charybdis of bureaucratic obstructionism in the Commission .
We need a programme that works : we have the means to do it and we have the will to do it in this Parliament .
The question is , do the Commission and Council accept their political priorities ?
I address my remarks to two senior politicians who both occupy positions of responsibility at a very sensitive time for Europe .
Mr President , the negative spiral of violence in the Middle East does not seem to be going into reverse , and plunged to another depth last week , when the hatred-sowing Hamas leader Yassin was cold-bloodedly murdered at the behest of the Israeli Prime Minister Sharon .
I call on the Palestinians not to use violence to avenge Sharon ’ s illegal act .
Now is the time to break the cycle and opt for peaceful resistance in a dignified manner .
I would echo the appeal by a group of Palestinian academics not to commit any new suicide attacks .
Prime Minister Sharon violates human rights , ignores UN resolutions by building a wall in the Occupied Territories , by building new settlements and by the extrajudicial executions of Palestinians .
The Israeli-Palestinian situation is a seriously disturbing factor in the entire region .
What the Middle East needs is a broad democratic initiative for dialogue and cooperation between all countries in it , and Europe possesses the appropriate instruments to bring one about .
We must organise the partnerships between the EU and the Mediterranean countries in the framework of the Barcelona process , in which we strategically promote political and economic , but also social , reforms , in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
I am convinced that there is a great political need for this among the citizens of both Israel and Palestine .
Working for peace in the Middle East is a huge contribution in the fight against terrorism .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as regular as clockwork , we make high-flown statements and condemn the violence in the Middle East .
Is that really all we can manage to do ?
Why can the European Union not play a more active role in this conflict ?
Right now , there are various reasons why the European Union should be playing a pioneering role in the peace process .
Sadly , recent events have made a further radicalisation between Israel and the Palestinians more than likely .
The status of the United States as a good international negotiator has been dealt a few serious blows after Afghanistan and Iraq .
The implementation of the international step-by-step plan appears a long way off , so the European Union should act .
Peace and stability are entirely in its interest . After all , we are the region &apos;s largest trading partner and the largest donor of humanitarian and financial aid .
When will our words at last be followed by deeds ?
Mr President , I recently attended a conference of Arab women in Beirut .
The women were from 22 different Arab countries .
What struck me was that they all speak a common language , which gave them a unity that perhaps we still aspire to here in Europe .
Regardless of what they spoke about at that conference – and they were all highly educated , sophisticated women – the issue of Palestine was mentioned by every single person .
Clearly , this issue is a hugely unifying factor throughout all the Arab countries .
We in Ireland have learned – tragically and dreadfully over a thirty-year period – what it is to live with terrorism .
We have also seen some of the bitterest enemies in the world take a leap of faith that led to peace in Northern Ireland – to the great relief of all of us .
Commissioner Patten clearly had a part in that as well .
There is also another generation of children on the other side of the border who are too terrified to go to school in case the bus they are riding in is blown up .
These are the children who 20 years from now will be the leaders , or perhaps the victims , or the suicide bombers .
We all condemn unreservedly the dreadful events in both Palestine and Israel .
– Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , there is talk these days of a new Middle East policy , of a greater Middle East .
If it is not all going to be hot air , then in my opinion two things in particular must remain at the heart of such a policy .
Firstly , resolution of the main conflict in the Middle East .
I wish the US would devote as much energy – by which I do not mean military manpower – to solving the actual Middle East problem as it is doing to Iraq .
I would also like Europe to expend as much energy solving the Middle East problem as some European Union Member States are doing in the case of Iraq , because there would then be fewer terrorist attacks and there would be fewer illegal killings like that of Sheikh Yassin .
As Commissioner Patten said , the culture of death must be defeated and destroyed .
Secondly , yes , the Arab world does indeed need reforms .
Unlike many of my fellow Members here , however , I have not seen much evidence of the Americans supporting the reform movements in Jordan , Egypt or Saudi Arabia in recent years .
I have not noticed them supporting democracy and human rights in those countries very much .
If the United States of America is now taking up that cause , I am very much in favour of joining them in supporting the reform efforts inside the Arab countries .
There are enough women who are dissatisfied with the continuing severe discrimination against women .
There are enough minorities who are dissatisfied with the discrimination against minorities .
There are enough people in the Arab countries who are dissatisfied with discrimination and disregard for human rights and the rights of minorities .
Not long ago , we welcomed to the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy people who had recently written a report showing where the obstacles lie , obstacles to modernisation and democratisation recognised by the Arab countries themselves .
I believe the only practical way forward for a new Middle East policy is not to threaten outside military intervention but for Europe , in particular , to support the reform forces in the Arab countries .
We should be doing more , spending more money and of course also using much more energy to drive those important reforms in the Arab countries forward .
Mr President , ten years after the Rabin / Arafat agreements , a neutral observer taking stock of the Blair / Gaddafi civilities would say that a miracle has taken place .
However , if he looked into it further , he would say that we have a greater tragedy .
Where is the balance ?
The balance is quite clearly worse today than it was ten years ago when there were events and political choices .
When it became clear from various quarters that the official government line was to murder people , we did not react .
When the new wall of shame started to be built , again we did not react .
A particular peculiarity distinguishes the shape of our policy . Yes !
We are the biggest financiers of the area , but to finance someone without intervening politically is basically like pouring water into a pitcher full of holes , into a bucket full of holes , which cannot hold the water .
What are we doing now ?
Quite clearly we have to take initiatives .
In a few days , as is our custom , the presiding country will meet the president of the United States of America in order to raise the imperative question of the joint approach to this issue .
It would , of course , be better if this meeting were held in Brussels at long last .
We are also talking about the Euro-Mediterranean conference and we all welcome the meeting in Athens at parliamentary level .
However , there must also be a corresponding initiative at government level .
In other words , if we cannot get to the heart of the problem , we must confine the problem .
It would not be a bad thing , for example , if we set up a special office in the area , based in Cyprus , to take account of all the irritations and take the corresponding initiatives .
Politics are not neutral .
Politics mean initiative , pro-action , proposals and results .
Mr President , a sustainable peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through serious negotiations and by complying with international law .
Building walls and new settlements on occupied territory does not contribute to peace .
Peace is never achieved through terrorist acts , on the part either of Israel or of the Palestinians .
No terrorist acts can be approved .
The murder of Sheik Yassin , ordered by Israel , is an act of terrorism and a crime under international law . It must be condemned .
It is obvious that Israel has broken the Association Agreement . The EU must not accept this .
A solution to the conflict demands increased active participation by the EU and also by the UN in the form not only of peacekeeping forces and increased support for the Palestinian people but also in the form of a clear political line .
Sharon has made it clear that he intends to order executions of more Palestinian leaders .
If the Israeli Government does not immediately abandon such plans , the agreement with Israel must be cancelled .
Agreements must be complied with by both parties .
Further indulgence of Israel and the Israeli Government does not help Israel .
Mr President , the assassination of Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and the seven other Palestinians was a clear breach of international law .
I totally condemn all terrorism , whatever its source , and I also call on Palestinians not to respond violently to this most recent provocation .
If we are to begin to bring an end to this spiral of violence , then someone has to take the first leap .
I abhor in particular the use of children as proxy bombers and the targeting of civilians by Palestinian terror groups .
The government of Ariel Sharon has once again adopted bully-boy tactics which can only block the peace process and obstruct any chance for constructive negotiations .
The continuing occupation of Palestinian territory and the construction of the so-called security wall , mostly on Palestinian territory , is ghettoising Palestinians , destroying their livelihoods , imprisoning and impoverishing them and driving them to despair .
The European Union , on the other hand , has all carrot and no stick .
It is not that the European Union does not have a stick , it simply refuses to even wave the stick , never mind use it .
I would call on the Commission and the Council to demand that Israel take immediate steps to comply with the human rights obligations it entered into in the association agreement .
It is not doing so and unless we take action to insist that they do , we will reap a terrible harvest in the future .
Mr President , peace in the Middle East hinges on a solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and on the entire European policy concerning strategic partnership .
When Cyprus joins on 1 May , Tel Aviv will be half an hour &apos;s flight away from the European Union , and we will be direct neighbours .
During the recent visit by Parliament &apos;s delegation , we noticed that many Israelis have high expectations of the European Union .
They are expecting us to take a leading role in the region .
Israel is being ruled by a man who rides roughshod over international law and who , in the present conflict , continues to pour oil upon the flames .
He is doing a great deal of damage to his country and gives international terrorists an excellent excuse for their actions .
According to the Council &apos;s declaration , the European Union is consistently opposed to extrajudicial executions .
In my view , the only consistent stance would be to review the trade relations and use our economic power as a carrot and a stick – but not only on Israel .
. Mr President , I will be very brief .
I should like to thank the Members who have participated .
This has been a useful discussion , and it has also made clear that there exists a fundamental consensus amongst us on the need for the European Union to exert maximum effort on the issues that have been raised .
We all agree that the European Union needs to raise the level of its engagement within the region .
I agree particularly with Members as to the importance of intensive consultation with the countries involved in the region .
The drive and the initiative to address these challenges and to implement the necessary reforms must come from the region itself .
It is easy to be in despair when you see , as we have seen , horror heaped on horror , misery on top of misery .
However , the reality is that the Union must be involved in pushing forward where it can to try and create at least a space in which peace can be created .
The Union must work in partnership with the region to this end , to help to meet all of these challenges .
A lasting and comprehensive settlement is set out in the roadmap , and the roadmap is the only way forward .
It was mentioned that the suspension of the Association Agreement is a way forward in the region .
I think that discussion and pressure would produce some progress .
In the interim report on the strategic partnership endorsed by the Council last week , the European Union has established a set of guiding principles for its engagement in the region .
The presidency is committed to developing the strategic partnership on the basis of partnership and dialogue with all the countries in the region .
Once again , I should like to thank Members for their thoughtful and incisive contributions .
Thank you , Mr Roche , despite the authoritative calls and the quotes from Shakespeare , Homer and Ulysses , Commissioner Patten has informed me that he does not intend to reply .
The debate is closed .
.
The murder by Israel of the spiritual leader of Hamas confirms once again the murderous / terrorist nature of the policy followed by the Sharon government in order to subjugate the heroic Palestinian people .
It comes in the wake of a cluster of similar murders , which some people are justifying in the name of protection from terrorism .
The Sharon government would not dare to commit crimes if it did not have direct support and encouragement from the USA .
For its part , the ΕU is continuing its policy of tolerance and support for Israel which puts the slaughterers and the slaughtered on an equal footing .
The summit in Brussels confined itself to expressing its opposition to ‘ extra-judicial killings ’ ( as it calls the murders ) , but recognised ‘ Israel ’ s right to protect its citizens against terrorist attacks ’ .
It also expresses its support for the pacifist forces in Israel and for all those who refuse to serve in the army and the occupied territories .
There will be no peace in the area until the people of Palestine have a homeland .
. The situation in the Middle East has been with us for decades .
We have shown solidarity , in various ways , with the Palestinian people , and with those individuals and groups in Israel who are fighting for peace in the region .
A joint initiative for peace , stability and democracy throughout the Middle East , in the words of the title of this Council and Commission declaration , would be worthy of our support if it were indeed a joint initiative for peace .
What we cannot accept is that fine titles or headings disguise the imbalances inherent in the situation and even suggest misleading interpretations of events .
Terrorism cannot be justified by attacks on terrorism ; nor can terrorism be glossed over by giving it a euphemistic label such as ‘ extra-judicial killing ’ or something that uses a similar degree of linguistic imagination .
The assassination of the Hamas leader , irrespective of what we think of that organisation , has contributed nothing towards peace in the Middle East ; quite the opposite , in fact .
Similarly , the fact that Ariel Sharon ’ s fascistic government is not being held to account for the escalation of violence and terror contributes nothing towards peace in the Middle East .
Parliament and the European Union must adopt clear and unequivocal positions to condemn terrorism , but such positions will only have credibility when they condemn the terrorist policies of the Israeli Government and when those positions lead to concrete political and diplomatic measures , such as suspending the association agreement with Israel .
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the situation in Kosovo .
Mr President , we were all shocked at the eruption of ethnically motivated violence in Kosovo on 17 and 18 March . The latest outbreak resulted in death and injury and the displacement of 3000 people .
It also resulted in the destruction of places of worship , hospitals and schools which were deliberately targeted in an attack on our shared vision of a multi-ethnic Kosovo .
While the situation in Kosovo has stabilised since 18 March , it remains very tense .
The KFOR international peacekeeping force has been strengthened significantly in response to the violence .
I pay tribute to the efforts of all who worked hard to stabilise the situation and to restore calm in Kosovo .
I would also like to offer my condolences and those of the Council to all who have once again suffered loss of life , injury and loss of loved ones .
The General Affairs and External Relations Council , on 22 March , and the European Council , on 26 March , condemned the violence , loss of life , the damage to property and the destruction of religious and cultural heritage in Kosovo .
The full commitment of the European Union to the development of a secure , democratic and multi-ethnic Kosovo , in line with UN Security Council Resolution 1244 has been reaffirmed once again .
The European Union strongly supports the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in Kosovo , Harri Holkeri , the United Nations mission in Kosovo and KFOR in their determined efforts to stabilise the situation and to ensure the full implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 .
I would like to underscore the strong support of the European Union for the United Nations policy of Standards before Status .
That policy , together with Security Council resolution 1244 , remains the foundation of the international community ’ s commitment to Kosovo .
The European Union is considering how it can strengthen its role in support of the UN Standards before Status policy .
The recent violent events have risked undermining the painstakingly achieved progress that has been made to date .
It is important now that we assert the primacy of politics in Kosovo and ensure that there is no further descent into ethnic violence .
The explosion of sectarianism would be to the detriment of all in Kosovo .
It is clear that the future of the people of that country lies in the eventual integration of the countries of the Western Balkans into the European Union structures , as agreed at the EU-Western Balkans summit in June 2003 .
The implementation of the UN Standards before Status policy is the key to achieving that goal .
However , the issue of final status in Kosovo can only be addressed once sufficient progress has been made on the implementation and review of standards .
Despite the recent violence and the continuing tensions , this will have to include the resumption of the process of dialogue on practical matters between Belgrade and Pristina .
As this House is aware , at the request of the General Affairs and External Relations Council , High Representative Solana visited Kosovo on 24 March .
Commissioner Patten accompanied him on the visit .
They took with them a clear message .
Political leaders in Kosovo , especially the Kosovo Albanian leadership , need to take responsibility for the situation and ensure that there is no repeat of ethnically motivated violence , or of threats of such violence . Those responsible for the violence must be brought to justice .
Kosovo ’ s Provisional Institutions of Self-Government must demonstrate their commitment to a multi-ethnic Kosovo .
Last week ’ s European Council called on them to take an immediate step in this direction by allocating resources for the urgent reconstruction of damaged property , including places of worship , to ensure that internally displaced persons can return safely to their homes .
I welcome the allocation by the Provisional Institutions of EUR 5 million to assist with reconstruction , and the unanimous declaration of the Kosovo Assembly on 26 March to condemn the recent violence .
Welcome as they are , words are not enough .
It is time to see real efforts to reach across ethnic divisions so that a Kosovo in which all can live peaceably and in security is created .
To this end , political leaders in Kosovo must now work more closely with the United Nations mission in Kosovo and with KFOR for the protection of the rights of all sections of the population , including members of minority communities .
What has happened in Kosovo over the past few weeks is a reminder to us all of the importance of the role that the European Union plays , not just in Kosovo , but in the wider region .
The European Union has taken the lead role in working with the countries of the Western Balkans to consolidate peace and stability in the region , and to promote economic development and the respect for human rights and the rule of law .
European Union assistance in the region in support of those objectives will amount to EUR 4.65 billion over the period 2000-2006 .
The Union , including its Member States , continues to be the most important source of funding for the international efforts in Kosovo .
Moreover , European Union Member States make the largest troop contributions to KFOR .
The development of ever closer relations with the Western Balkans is a priority for the European Union .
Since last year ’ s Thessaloniki Summit , the European Union and the countries of the Western Balkans have a shared agenda for progress .
The objective of eventual integration will be pursued through the Stabilisation and Association Process and through implementation of the series of agreements which brought an end to the tragic conflicts of the past 13 years .
In the case of Kosovo , the Stabilisation and Association Process tracking mechanism initiated by the European Commission in the spring of 2003 is designed to facilitate Kosovo ’ s progress within the Stabilisation and Association Process , bringing Kosovo within the embrace of the European family .
Our efforts to promote the European perspective of Kosovo and the United Nations policy of implementing standards are mutually reinforcing policies .
Both sides of the relationship made commitments at Thessaloniki which must be implemented fully .
Those responsible for the recent violence in Kosovo must be brought to justice .
There should be no wall of silence , there should be no culture of impunity .
It is time to move forward , away from the hurt and the anger which have blighted Kosovo ’ s politics for so long .
The path to take has been mapped out by the United Nations , in its Standards before Status policy .
I would like to repeat the Council ’ s support for Special Representative Holkeri , for his United Nations colleagues , and for KFOR , in their determination to stabilise the situation and to ensure the implementation of Security Council resolution 1244 in full .
It is the responsibility of all , but particularly of Kosovo ’ s leaders , to support the work already in train to ensure a stable future for a secure , democratic , prosperous and multi-ethnic Kosovo , with its place in Europe .
The European Union is ready to help in the achievement of this goal .
It is up to the people in Kosovo now to take up the offers made .
.
Mr President , I am extremely glad to have the opportunity to speak to the House today about Kosovo .
As the presidency noted , I went with Mr Javier Solana to Kosovo last week , because of our concern about the recent upsurge in violence .
During those terrible days and nights , a very large number of homes were destroyed , together with schools , medical facilities and a large number of churches .
The latest reports suggest that 22 people were killed and more than 850 injured , including police and KFOR members .
There is little doubt that although there may have been an initial trigger for the violence , it quickly became organised .
I also have no doubt that elements within the main Albanian political parties were involved .
We should remember that Europe rightly took a stand against the disgraceful ethnic cleansing by Milosevic in 1999 .
Since then , the international community has spent EUR 2 billion – not including defence costs – to try to rebuild Kosovo .
We did not do that in order to see Kosovar Serbs being ethnically cleansed in their turn .
Let me share with the House my reflections on my visit to Kosovo .
I have to say that the High Representative and I were extremely disappointed .
We saw at first hand the anger and upset of Serbs in a suburb of Pristina called Kosovo Polje .
We were looking for evidence that Kosovar Albanian leaders understood those feelings .
There was precious little sign of it .
On the contrary , there was an attempt to blame everyone but themselves for what had happened .
There was one exception to this .
The Prime Minister , Mr Rexhepi , rose to the occasion .
He showed considerable courage in visiting trouble spots to try to defuse tensions .
He also immediately understood the responsibility of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government to put right the terrible wrongs that were done to Kosovar Serbs .
Before we arrived , he had decided to set up a reconstruction fund with an initial budget of EUR 5 million .
He understood that it was the duty of his government to put things right , not the responsibility of the international community .
I did not go to Pristina to promise that European taxpayers ’ money would be used instead .
That would be completely unacceptable .
Mr Rexhepi promised that rapid action would be taken to repair damaged property so that people could get back to their homes as quickly as possible .
Mr Solana and I promised to go back through the summer so that we could see for ourselves that progress on reconstruction is actually occurring .
What are the priorities now ?
NATO has reacted swiftly to increase troop numbers in order to provide better security .
This has had an immediate effect on calming tensions in Kosovo , although we have to remain extremely vigilant about the situation .
Next , UNMIK police are trying as quickly as possible to identify those responsible for these attacks so that they can be taken out of circulation and punished .
It is incumbent on the leaders of the Albanian political parties to purge their ranks of such people .
Next , there needs to be an investigation of the role played by the Kosovo police service in the disturbances .
There were reports that some members of the police service did their duty well , but there have also been reports of police service members either taking no action to prevent these attacks or , worse still , participating in them .
UNMIK is determined to get to the bottom of what actually happened .
Next , we have to be quite clear that we stand fully behind UNMIK .
There were clear signs of organised attacks on UNMIK property and staff .
That is completely unacceptable .
The European Union strongly supports the UN as an institution .
We cannot tolerate attacks on the UN , whether in Kosovo or anywhere else .
We also need to work very closely with our United States partners .
Mr Solana and I had a very constructive meeting with Marcie Ries , the American Representative in Pristina .
We all agreed that we needed to make it absolutely clear to the Kosovars that we are at one in our reaction to these events .
Finally , it is absolutely essential that the political leaderships in Belgrade and Pristina refrain from provocative statements which can only serve to exacerbate tensions .
Final status discussions are for another day .
Last week ’ s declaration by the Serbian Parliament insisting on permanent sovereignty for Serbia and a system of cantons inside Kosovo was extremely unhelpful , to say the least .
So were statements by Kosovar Albanian leaders in the immediate aftermath of the violence that they would not accept anything short of independence .
It is always tempting after horrible events like these to conclude that we should rip up our strategy and come up with a new plan .
I must be absolutely clear with the House on this : I do not believe that we can give up on our insistence on a multi-ethnic Kosovo in which all ethnic groups can live freely and without fear .
Nor do I believe that we should abandon the idea of standards before status .
On the other hand , we should not send a signal that final status discussions will be delayed indefinitely .
That would risk a grave worsening of tension .
Nothing that happened earlier this month can change the geography of Kosovo .
We all have a shared interest in making sure that Kosovo does not become a black hole in the middle of south-east Europe , where organised crime flourishes and ethnic division is entrenched .
We have to go on working patiently for the long-term future .
Whatever Kosovo ’ s final status , its future lies in Europe .
I hope that point will be understood and that the community will turn its back on violence and move towards stability , prosperity , multi-ethnicity , pluralism and democracy .
– Mr President , Commissioner , if I am honest , the situation in Kosovo makes me feel both sad and helpless .
In 1999 , we went to war to stop the expulsion and repression of the Albanians in Kosovo .
I was in favour of that ; after all , I had visited the country and its people since 1990 and had experienced terrible things , including torture , experienced the apartheid regime for myself .
I naively believed that everything would then improve .
I could not imagine that the same Albanians who had suffered all that would now do the same wrongs to their fellow human beings of other nationalities – Serbs , Roma , Ashkali .
They did , in the end with obviously planned and criminal acts of violence .
Many people died or became refugees and cultural heritage was desecrated .
What is more , they then attacked hospitals and schools , which we had probably helped to pay for , KFOR and UNMIK .
It is clear who was behind it .
I believe the ordinary Albanian people know , too .
The Albanian leadership ’ s protest and distancing of itself was not loud enough or convincing enough for me .
This terrible act of violence has set Kosovo back a long way .
Is that how it wants to join the EU , as Mr Patten said ?
The criminals there do not want to join the EU ; they do not want to live together in a civilised manner .
They want strife because strife gives them scope for corruption and crime .
Everything is now in ruins .
I do not believe that the international community has pressed hard enough for those Serbs who want to return to do so ; it has not provided all the necessary accompanying measures .
I would not want to return to an enclave either , neither would I want always to have to be protected by KFOR .
That is why not enough has been done here .
We need to think about that .
The government in Belgrade has deliberately prevented the local Serbs from being actively involved in shaping Kosovo .
It has established parallel structures , fearing that Serb involvement in Kosovo would be the seal of Kosovo ’ s independence .
I do not believe that ‘ Standards before Status ’ is the only way ; so far , it has led us astray .
It should be ‘ Standards and Status ’ .
We must now set about solving the questions of status .
The powder keg of Kosovo will not be kept under control without a trustworthy vision for the future .
Sixty per cent of the population are young people and 50 % of them have no work .
How are we to deal with that when leaders come along who are always stirring things up because Kosovo ’ s future is not clear ?
We should give some thought to whether we should not press on more with privatisation and support for businesses , offering financial assistance for jobs that are open to both Albanians and Serbs like in Serbia under Milosevic – similar to the ‘ oil for democracy ’ plan .
So let there be financial assistance for that ; I believe this is where the EU could prove useful .
The UN must relinquish more of its responsibility to the government in Kosovo and Belgrade must put an end to its parallel structures .
Then Albanians and Serbs will at last have to see that they can only govern the country together and that they will only be able to join Europe together , in a country where they have made peace and live together peacefully .
Otherwise , any aid from us will really be pointless .
– Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , three things struck me after our last visit to Pristina .
Firstly , quite considerable progress has been made in the material situation .
Not least , I am pleased to say , because of the good work done by the Reconstruction Agency .
Secondly , the United Nations is doing a good job there , albeit hampered not least by excessive bureaucracy .
Hardly anything has changed , however , in the heads of the political representatives of the various ethnic groups in Kosovo .
That is true of the Serbs , as becomes clear when you look at how little real cooperation there is between the ministers in the Rexhepi government and when you consider that there is still a parallel structure for the Serbs .
It is true above all , however , of the representatives of the Albanian majority in Kosovo .
With perhaps a few exceptions , which the Commissioner has mentioned , they are unfortunately not yet prepared to agree to a multi-ethnic state , and not only to agree to it verbally but also to make it reality .
The President-in-Office of the Council has said that we are the biggest donor , we have the largest military presence .
Why should I have to persuade a European taxpayer to continue providing money for a state whose only aim , or whose political leadership ’ s only aim is to create an ethnically pure state in Europe ?
Why should we , equally , subsidise and support Belgrade if Belgrade is not prepared to accept a joint multi-ethnic entity ( let us say ) or a multi-ethnic state ?
I have always advocated moving towards independence for Kosovo , but is the Albanian leadership in Kosovo doing its part for that independence , namely creating the conditions for it ?
After all the things you have rightly said , Commissioner , Mr President-in-Office , we must draw the obvious conclusion .
If the worst comes to the worst , we must withdraw our support if we find things are going the wrong way .
We will not help things here with fine words . They may be hearing the fine words , but the leadership is not taking any notice .
I still do not see that happening .
I am really looking to the Council and Commission to act accordingly .
– Mr President , the latest events in Kosovo show once again how fragile the peace in the Balkans is , and we must ask ourselves what the reasons are for that .
Let us remind ourselves .
Almost exactly five years ago , NATO began bombing Yugoslavia without declaring war .
Although all the parties to the Helsinki Final Act had committed themselves to recognising the territorial status quo in Europe , the country was systematically dismembered by internal and external forces along ethnic lines ; the Federal Republic of Germany led the way with its early recognition of Slovenia and Croatia .
The rapid disintegration of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia did not bring an end to the conflicts , but gave rise to new tensions , which are now again exploding in bloody clashes in Kosovo .
What was proclaimed five years ago as the remedy for ethnic cleansing has proved to be the opposite .
Thousands of Serbian families have been driven out of a province that is still legally part of Serbia , mainly by paramilitary forces of the Kosovo Liberation Army ( UCK ) , once classed by the US as a terrorist organisation .
It also sounds very strange when Mr Solana , our High Representative , tells the remaining Serbs that they should be brave and have the courage to overcome these difficulties .
Crimes are being committed , and they must be treated as such .
The EU must have the courage to speak out more resolutely for a long-term , complex political solution for Kosovo and for the whole of the Balkans .
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , let us not beat about the bush .
The possibility of this happening was known to anyone who has followed the situation in Kosovo over the past year .
I too find it far too easy only to point at the extremists .
Of course , they are behind the attacks – which are also in my opinion sickening – on Serbs , their villages and their churches , but feelings of disappointment and distrust , but also aggression , are widely spread among the population .
I have to admit that I myself am in favour of the proposals of the so-called independent Kosovo Committee of more than two years ago , in which a case was made for conditional independence .
In that respect , the Kosovars who are behind those attacks have done their people a huge disservice .
If the Kosovars themselves are unable to keep their own extremists under control , there is no hope of fulfilling the most important condition for independence , which is respect for minorities .
I am sorry to have to say this , Mr Roche , but what you are saying is more of the same and the policy you advocate has led to these problems .
As I see it , the status quo – doing what we are doing now – is no longer an option at present .
However , the message of this Parliament to the Kosovars and the Kosovan authorities should also be clear : let your people not be taken hostage by a few criminal troublemakers .
Be brave in your rejection ; say much more clearly than you have done to date that this is unacceptable , but also take this one brave message to your people : Kosovo must be tolerant , or else Kosovo will cease to be .
Mr President , as we have maintained and pointed out to this Parliament and the Council on many occasions , the latest tragedies that have taken place in Kosovo show that peace and democracy are not things that are obtained for ever , not even in Europe , but objectives that must be reconfirmed every day .
Not only peace and democracy are being challenged but also the dignity of the person and respect for a common cultural heritage .
The Union must step up its presence in Kosovo and call on the Albanian , Serbian and Montenegrin authorities to defend the rights of the minorities and protect Serbian Orthodox cultural sites .
It does not make sense to have quite rightly protested against the Buddha being destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan if then the politicians and intellectuals remain shamefully silent about the destruction of so many Orthodox churches and monuments , which belong to a culture that embodies the values that we are endeavouring to protect .
The valuable frescoes that have for centuries adorned the Orthodox temples and monasteries in the Balkan region are the heritage of humankind as a whole and must be safeguarded and protected from any risk of destructive folly , as we have stressed in our resolution .
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs did well to make more men available to NATO to strengthen the contingent charged with keeping the peace and guaranteeing safety .
For its part , the United Nations should provide for a programme to reconstruct the destroyed resources and to outline Kosovo ’ s final statute .
What we also want , however , is a stronger presence for Europe , and this is why we would point out that a European army , as called for by the Convention , is an objective that cannot be put off any longer .
Mr President , in 1999 , Serbia , crushed by NATO bombing , had to give up exercising sovereignty over part of its territory , Kosovo .
At the time , our governments justified this violation of international law by invoking the need to avoid ethnic cleansing of the Albanian population and the plan to turn Kosovo into a peaceful , multicultural society .
This was , in particular , Dr Kouchner &apos;s ambition .
Five years later , reality has brutally shattered this Utopian dream .
The billions spent by our countries , as Mr Patten mentioned just now , and the thousands of soldiers we are deploying there are not preventing the Muslims from ethnically cleansing the 200 000 Serbs still living in Kosovo .
Rather than issuing soothing statements dismissing both the victims and the culprits without pronouncing in favour of either , our leaders should think about their responsibility .
Above all , they should put an end to this violation of international law , which Serbia has a right to see respected , as do the other states in the region . This is all the more true because our people are not safe from the tragedy now afflicting the Kosovar Serbs .
Sixty years ago , Albanian Muslims were still in the minority in this province , which is the historic heart of Serbia .
A few decades of socialism , Albanian immigration and a falling birth rate among the Serbs reversed the proportions : the Serbs became a minority in their own land and are finally being driven out of their homes , their fields and their churches .
Many regions in our countries are undergoing the start of this process .
Some districts , like here in Strasbourg , or even whole towns now have a Muslim majority and are gradually escaping from our laws and being taken over by gangs that will be succeeded by Sharia law .
The tragedy in Kosovo is sounding a warning .
We must change policy .
European comrades , do not ask for whom the bell tolls : it tolls for thee .
Mr President , I think that everyone was pretty shocked at the images we saw of the recent violence in Kosovo , which aroused memories of the situation we experienced in the 1990s .
What was actually positive was the speed of the response from the international community , and the European Union in particular , but also from various EU Member States who quickly reinforced the military forces on the ground there and managed to stop the violence from escalating any further .
Many people here have already said that we must continue to encourage those responsible in Kosovo itself , but also the people in Serbia and possibly in Albania as well , to participate in finding an achievable solution .
I subscribe to the comments made by fellow MEPs pointing out the stalemate that has arisen in Kosovo .
As a result , many people can no longer see a way out ; this situation also gives those who want to cause trouble and who have created the recent problems the opportunity to do so .
I think that we need to pay particular attention to the socio-economic situation .
The high levels of unemployment in the country are severely hampering the chance of finding a solution to the problems .
I remain , however , convinced that we must continue to work towards a society in which the two ethnic groups can cooperate and live together , and I am also of the opinion that the ethnic groups can be called to account about their responsibilities .
An answer to the question as to what the definitive status of Kosovo should be , can , however , only be given once we have achieved a kind of internal stability that engenders trust and once there is a conviction that the two ethnic groups can live together peacefully .
Until such time as this happens , I fear that the international community , we ourselves in other words , will have to stay on there and that we will regularly have to take action in the way we have done over the past few weeks .
I fully agree with Mr Patten that this is a European risk which requires a European answer .
We cannot allow a black hole to develop in that part of Europe , and that is why it is also so important for us to have responded the way we did .
We should also , however , think about what might have to be a harder line in the future in order to ensure that we achieve a breakthrough in the stalemate I was talking about earlier .
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , may I first state clearly that I condemn all forms of violence .
May I also state clearly that I am absolutely in favour of a multiethnic Kosovo .
I would prefer to call it Kosova , which is the Albanian term for Kosovo .
I agree with Mr Joost Lagendijk when he said that it was inevitable that violence would break out sooner or later in Kosova .
Anyone who has ever visited the divided city of Mitrovica knew that it would take little to trigger an uprising .
The riots and lynch mobs were easy to anticipate .
It is therefore necessary to take the wind out of the sails of the hard-liners among the Kosovar Albanians .
To do this , we must eliminate the traumas .
Traumas from the past , traumas from the exodus of 1999 , the traumas that still haunt the Albanian Kosovars concerning their almost 4 000 missing friends , acquaintances , brothers , sisters , fathers and mothers .
Four thousand people are still missing .
They have either disappeared or they are still locked up in Serbian prisons on very vague charges .
Traumas from the present as well .
Is it not true that in the north the international community is in fact applying the secret pact between Milosevic and the Russian generals in which the north of Kosova actually becomes Serbian territory ?
Whichever way you look at it , the Albanian Kosovars in Mitrovica , 85 % of the population , are still being held hostage by the Serbs .
Unemployment in the Albanian part is two-and-a-half times higher than in the Serbian part .
The Albanian Kosovars in Mitrovica in the southern part earn two-and-a-half times less than the Serbs in the northern part .
The international community ’ s official standpoint is still before status .
I would therefore like to call for a ‘ both-and ’ approach .
We must aim for both and status .
Only an independent Kosova will bring true peace to the region .
At least , as long as multi-ethnicity is also respected by the Albanian Kosovars .
I have received five motions for resolution to wind up this debate in accordance with Rule 37 ( 2 ) of the Rules of Procedure . ( 1 )
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place on Thursday .
. – Recent events in Kosovo have completed the ethnic cleansing , with the expulsion of the remaining Serbs and gypsies and the seizure of their property .
Kosovo &apos;s separation from Serbia and the creation of an independent state are being promoted , as pursued by the autonomist organisations of Albanian Kosovars from the beginning , by safeguarding the purity of the Albanian-speaking population .
The abettor of and main accessory to this crime against hundreds of thousands of Serbs and gypsies is ΝΑΤΟ , together with the ΕU , which agreed with the intervention and the bombings .
The international NATO force set up in Kosovo in order to apply Security Council Resolution 1441 , instead of disarming the criminal gangs of the KLA , as it should have done , proclaimed them the Kosovo Protection Corps .
We MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece condemn those responsible for this tragedy and express our solidarity with the fight of the Yugoslav people to expel the invaders .
.
The absence of clear , enforceable rules for feed hygiene is one of the final major &apos; missing links &apos; to complete our &apos; farm to fork &apos; food safety approach .
I shall briefly refer to three main points of the proposal .
First , it provided for the compulsory registration of all feed business establishments by the competent authorities within the Member States .
I am pleased that there has been close cooperation between Parliament , Council and Commission to seek a workable compromise with a view to reaching a first reading agreement in relation to this proposal .
From farm to table , the criteria for the production of our food should be very clearly defined .
Quite apart from the harm to food , the food scandals over recent years – BSE , dioxin or nitrophene , for example – cost the European taxpayer a very great deal of money in terms of products recalled .
That , I believe , is a reason why the regulation has to very precisely define what a ‘ feed business operator ’ is .
I do not think there is any contention about the need for the requirement to take out insurance not to be imposed on farmers who produce cereals or other primary feedingstuffs .
The recipients in the feed manufacturing industry are already able to analyse and categorise the barley , rye , maize , and so on with which they are supplied .
It cannot be acceptable for rules to be made , for the purpose of precautionary insurance cover , some of which it is in fact impossible to comply with .
I still believe that what we demand politically should not ignore the realities of life , and that applies in particular to threshold values for undesirable substances when compounded , or transferred , and so on , which are increasingly based on what is analytically feasible .
Let me reiterate that you have lost touch with the protection of health if you go about finding a lump of sugar in Lake Constance .
To an increasing extent , threshold values are being determined by reference to what modern analysis can do rather than to the potential risk , and we should concentrate on the actual danger posed to the consumers .
Insurance companies have made it clear to a hearing with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development that , in the absence of any clear definition of what is meant by ‘ risk ’ , the costs involved in financial guarantees would become quite incalculable , and they would find it very difficult to estimate them .
My appeal to the producers is that they should start with voluntary insurance .
That is why , Commissioner , I , as rapporteur , have called in Article 8 for a feasibility study on binding and non-binding guarantees , and if we get one in 12 months ’ time , then I am sure we will be able to look further ahead .
This feasibility study should not only examine the national regulations currently in force , and the systems and practices relating to liability in the feed sector and similar areas at the national level , but should also set out recommendations for such a feasible and practicable guarantee system at EU level .
So let me say once again , that we should demand politically only those things that are practically feasible .
I am on tenterhooks to see what happens next , and whether we will indeed be able to come to an agreement following first reading .
. Mr President , I thank Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for her report and also for listening to the ideas that I put forward in the opinion from the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development .
We all recognise the need for feed to be safe .
If animal feed is safe , then consumers feel safe when eating animal products .
While we recognise the need to be able to identify and isolate all those producers and feed businesses involved in the food production chain , I believe this should be done without adding another tier of registration .
We recognise the need for a complete identification of all feed business operators , including farms , by adapting existing regulation systems in order to enable the competent authorities to inspect operators .
However , national regulation systems which are already in place and functioning for other purposes should be utilised wherever possible to avoid unnecessary duplication and regulation .
Currently , the majority of farms can be identified through their participation in these schemes .
I welcome the Commission &apos;s proposals whereby feed businesses , except those involved solely in primary production , will be required to adopt the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points principles .
HACCP is a method of identifying potential hazards and ensuring that proper control strategies are in place , and I welcome that .
As Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert mentioned , the area of most serious concern in the Commission &apos;s proposals is the use of financial guarantees .
All feed businesses , including farms , would need to fulfil a new requirement of having financial guarantees in place to cover the cost of withdrawn products in the event of a feed safety incident .
This would be restricted to the withdrawal , treatment and possible destruction of products .
Having consulted with the farming industry , feed manufacturers and the insurance sector , we find that the consequences of introducing financial guarantees have not been sufficiently analysed .
The feasibility of financial guarantees or insurance policies has not been properly developed with the industry and it is unclear whether such guarantees would be available from the insurance sector .
The cost implications for feed manufacturers and farmers from such a guarantee scheme are also unclear .
Therefore , we would like the Commission to look at this in more detail before bringing this in .
Finally , we are very concerned that feed coming in from outside the European Union also meets these very strict criteria .
Mr President , I apologise to Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert for having missed her remarks .
A mass meeting of the railway workers who have recently been dismissed is taking place outside , and that was where I was .
I am sorry that we were unable to reach a full compromise agreement on the central issue here – the only one which I have time to address .
Like Mr Parish , I have listened to , and paid reasonable attention to , the fears that we have not really made a market or tested out a market in terms of the provision of insurance .
I know that pushes the Commission further than in an ideal world it would like to go .
However , given that the vast majority of Member States and the Council take this view or a stronger one in terms of the proposals , if we are to achieve any kind of agreement at first reading here there has to be an indication – perhaps there already has been – that we will follow that line .
I am not personally in favour of a system that shifts to one of voluntarism on an ad hoc basis state by state , nor is my Group .
We know all our lessons from the history of food problems .
The provision of food and feed over the years since we first began to introduce a general food and feed law suggests that we need to have measures that apply right across the Community .
It is no good saying that anyone can opt out of those measures .
I hope the rapporteur will see that after a proper study and a reasonable length of time – and to me that means 12 months – we will arrive at that position .
I hope , for its part , the Commission can also accept that .
.
I understand the view expressed in the House in favour of financial guarantees .
However , I have also to take into account the view of the Council , where there is a qualified majority in favour of deleting the provision on guarantees .
It is clear to me that if first reading agreement is to be reached , this House will need to support the amendment to delete the guarantees in line with the compromise proposed .
The Commission could then come forward with a report on all aspects of the situation .
This would enable full consultation of all economic actors and stakeholders .
I have to say that a very persuasive factor is the fact that the insurance industry across the Community , including the enlarged Community , is not ready for mandatory financial guarantees across the board .
There is little point in legislating if we cannot be assured of effective compliance .
So I would strongly urge the House to support the amendment in relation to guarantees ; otherwise a golden opportunity for first reading agreement will be lost .
Based on the compromise reached , I understand that the rapporteur has tabled amendments which the Commission can accept and thereby facilitate closure in first reading .
Finally , I would like to state that a full listing of the Commission &apos;s position on the amendments is being provided to Parliament .
I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings of this part-session ( 1 ) .
The debate is closed .
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon .
.
Allow me to draw your attention to the principal elements of the Commission &apos;s proposal to replace the framework directive of 1989 on materials and articles in contact with food .
First , the proposal extends the scope of the regulation to include innovative types of packaging , known as &apos; active &apos; and &apos; intelligent &apos; , and provides the general legal framework for their safe use .
It sets the general principles of safety and labelling and allows for additional rules , if necessary , to be adopted in implementing measures .
Second , the proposal will ensure better traceability and labelling of materials and articles intended to come into contact with food .
Third , it increases transparency and legal certainty for operators , by describing the procedure for the authorisation of substances used for food contact materials .
Finally , the proposal will give the possibility to adopt not only directives , but also decisions or regulations , as the latter are more appropriate for certain provisions , such as lists of authorised substances .
The proposal is in the interests of both consumers and industry .
It would enhance harmonisation of different sectors of materials in contact with food , including recycled materials and active and intelligent packaging .
I am grateful in particular to Mrs Thors for her intense efforts to adopt the proposal in first reading .
The Commission supports these efforts .
We can therefore accept all amendments that are part of the compromise package that is the result of close contact between the three institutions .
Mr President , Commissioner , we are about to see the approval of a framework for our food packaging .
It feels almost like a symbolic act because we have almost concluded all the legislative work surrounding the Green Paper on Food Law .
After everything else we have successfully resolved , we are now to create an overall framework .
I hope we succeed .
I wish to emphasise that we are concerned here with approving the principles that are to apply to material that comes into contact with food .
We are not approving new materials as such , but saying how matters should proceed .
In my view , the fact that we are laying down guidelines and establishing limits for what is to be approved is an example of good legislation .
In the future too , packages will on many occasions have to be expressly approved in the light of the particular substances and food they are to be used for .
For example , what is the fat content of the food with which the material comes into contact ?
I can guarantee consumers that we shall continue to be cautious so that , for example , phthalates are not released from soft plastic .
As the Commissioner said , there are three principal new developments : the new administration , and thus transparency , resulting from the setting up of a European Food Safety Agency ; the new principles incorporated into food legislation ; and , finally , the opportunity to approve active , intelligent packaging .
A majority in Parliament appears to be prepared to accept active packaging , that is to say packaging that can absorb oxygen and moisture in the environment or give off antioxidants .
Research projects carried out demonstrate , for example , that tomatoes and fruit retain their proper form for longer in the active packaging .
Correctly used , I believe that they can in actual fact lead to fewer additives .
That would be an advantage , because we are concerned about a possible link between additives and the increasing number of allergies .
I personally prefer active packaging around my bread .
I myself came across an unopened package after two years and found the bread completely unchanged .
As we said , active intelligent packaging should entail advantages for both consumers and manufacturers .
I can also envisage situations in which such packaging helps us save energy , something which would of course be of value .
One of the conditions of our approving the new types of packaging is that they should be compatible with Community legislation generally .
The substances that have been allowed into food must be approved , and active packaging must not be misleading to consumers .
A bad smell must not be covered by another smell .
Intelligent packaging can provide us with information about the way in which food has been stored and thus show whether it has been stored suitably .
We know , for example , that certain smoked food can be difficult to store in the right way .
Let us hope that , in the future , intelligent packaging will be developed that shows , for example , how smoked fish has been treated and whether it has been treated properly .
We know that , in this connection , problems have sometimes arisen involving listeria .
As the Commissioner said , we shall have discussions concerning the recycling of material , for the requirements have become stricter when it comes also to the use of plastic , metal and paper in packaging .
It is important for new regulations , backed by this regulation , to be adopted and for us to know with certainty that food packaging needs to be approved to ensure that it is safe .
More rules concerning traceability will be adopted , supported by , and in line with , the previously adopted legislation .
In its work , Parliament has tried to emphasise that the information to be preserved is that which is needed for investigating problems that may arise later .
I also believe that the rules on traceability that we are now laying down are important if all the parties are to have equal opportunities to be suppliers to large chains of food stores .
I am pleased that we have set out clear rules governing the language used and public access to records .
That aspect of the Commission ’ s proposal was not entirely clear .
Had there been more rules on the subject of unambiguous , binding regulations to promote sound administration , we should probably have avoided a number of amendments .
That was not , however , the case .
We therefore need to clarify matters here and now .
For my part , I regret the fact that the Council and the Commission did not wish to approve the independence of the Food Agency .
I hope that we can adopt this report at a single reading .
That would be the case if we were to vote in favour of blocks one and two .
That would be in keeping with the position at which we had arrived in our negotiations with the Council and with what COREPER approved last week .
I see no reason , however , for approving Amendment No 17 .
I wish to thank the Commission and the Council for their constructive cooperation .
Above all , I wish , however , to say a big thank you to the secretariat of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , as well as to our helpful official , Mrs Köykkä , for her excellent work .
It has been a pleasure to collaborate with her .
. Mr President , Mrs Thors , many thanks for your work .
I think it would be a very good idea to round this off in a first-reading agreement .
It is a fairly technical dossier , but I think that we will get a fair distance with it .
The internal market makes it necessary to harmonise regulations for the food industry and for packaging .
New developments require new standards .
Active and intelligent materials and objects are just such new developments .
Active materials interact with food in order to maintain or improve the condition of the food during its storage and to extend its shelf life .
Intelligent materials are being designed to provide information on the condition of food .
A possible development is a packaging material that changes colour when the milk in it turns sour or the food in it begins to perish .
These are all interesting developments and the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy wholeheartedly supports the Commission ’ s proposals , although it does have a few comments on these developments .
Firstly , active and intelligent materials must not be used to mislead the consumer .
The opportunities to do this exist , but we would like to state very emphatically that this is not the intention .
Secondly , traceability is necessary , but our committee believes that this need not go all the way back to the tree from which a paper bag is made .
A good system is sufficient .
Thirdly , the consequences for trading partners must not be inequitable , and no unnecessary trade barriers should be erected , particularly for developing countries .
I understand that some solutions have been put forward in this regard .
Finally , the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy is calling for the barriers to the use of recycled materials to be eliminated .
We cannot have a situation in which recycling is encouraged on the one hand and recycled materials are not permitted onto the market on the other .
Food safety is of course the yardstick in this area .
In short , our committee wants to see modern technologies being used for the benefit of the consumer and the environment .
Mr President , I should like to thank Mrs Thors for this report and all her work on it .
It confirms my already high opinion of her parliamentary talents .
She will be a sad loss to this Parliament when she goes back go Finland .
Here we have an active and intelligent packaging of a Commission proposal .
It has received broad support in our committees and in the responses from the Council and the Commission , which I found to be entirely constructive .
If we could do this more often , everybody &apos;s life would be simpler .
However , there were certain questions that we had to raise .
One was the extent to which traceability would be possible .
I am glad that Mrs Thors took on board my own amendments .
I accept her advice that we should not vote for Amendment No 17 .
Had she told me to go the other way , I would have done .
I believe that the issue of public openness on this matter is one we should take into account .
Another point that some of us are slightly concerned about – and it comes up time after time in these debates – is the precise role of the European Food Safety Authority .
Time after time the mantra comes up that there will be a reference to EFSA , that it will do this or that .
We were due to have heard from the chief executive of EFSA this week .
That has been postponed .
Where we are moving towards greater food safety , safer food packaging , better labelling and so on , we should not require EFSA to do all the work .
Where there is a measure of derogation built into this , all of the Member States seem to be reasonably happy with it .
Where the Commission has done a good job , we should move ahead and see how far the existing institutions can do it for themselves .
I wish this report well and equally Mrs Thors .
I congratulate her on this report .
Mr President , I must first say how sorry I am to have arrived late for the debate , meaning that I did not hear the rapporteur ’ s introduction .
Please do excuse me , but the debate began a little earlier than scheduled .
We have chosen to accept the compromise agreed upon .
We believe it to be reasonable , even if we should like to have gone further in certain areas , for example when it came to the content of Article 17 .
We have nonetheless chosen to approve the compromise .
We are fairly sceptical about the active and intelligent materials .
We nevertheless believe that the compromise is sound overall because it constitutes a clear improvement upon the original proposal .
That is a constructive step along the road .
Finally , I wish to emphasise that , in our opinion , traceability is very important .
Even though the rapporteur has attempted to improve the labelling rules , the decision-making procedures , including the procedure for authorisation by the European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA ) , and access to public documents , the report , as it stands , is still unacceptable to the Greens .
Whereas Community legislation on food additives is regulated in great detail , the Commission &apos;s proposal simply introduces a general procedural framework , putting great emphasis on comitology .
The door is left wide open for the introduction of active packaging , without providing a strict framework for specific substances .
We have been fighting for a very long time against the ever-increasing exposure of consumers to a whole host of additives and we refuse to let these become more widespread , which would be damaging to health .
The Greens therefore request that authorisation should be withheld from active packaging whose effects are not known , that it should be ensured that there are no toxic products in active packaging , and that Community legislation on food additives should be applied strictly if new food packaging is authorised .
If our proposals are rejected , we will be obliged to vote against this report , which does not adequately consider the possible consequences for consumer health .
How long will it be before we see urgent recalls of certain future types of packaging ?
.
Mr President , allow me once again to underline my appreciation of Mrs Thors &apos; excellent work , and to welcome the progress that has been made .
After only three months of fruitful collaboration between the three institutions , we are very close today to a first reading agreement .
If this is achieved , it will certainly be a record in terms of time .
Mrs Thors in her earlier contribution made reference to the near completion of the work that we have been undertaking – the necessity to put in place the legislation referred to in the White Paper on food safety .
I am happy to say that we have nearly completed that work .
